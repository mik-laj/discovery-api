    All security bulletins for Anthos GKE on-prem (GKE on-prem) are described in this topic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargos until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, GKE on-prem's
    <a href="/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/release-notes">
     Release notes
    </a>
    will refer to "security
updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the notes will be
updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.

     If you run multi-tenant workloads on GKE on-prem,
please pay particular attention to these bulletins. These vulnerabilities are
more likely to impact multi-tenant workloads. For a technical description of
security boundaries in GKE on-prem and how these impact workloads,

         We recently discovered and mitigated a vulnerability where the RBAC proxy
      used for securing monitoring endpoints did not correctly authorize users.

      privileges to access the resource in any namespace.
