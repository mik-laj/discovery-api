    All security bulletins for GKE on-prem are described in this topic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargos until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, GKE on-prem's
    <a href="/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/release-notes">
     Release notes
    </a>
    will refer to "security
updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the notes will be
updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.

         A networking vulnerability,

          CVE-2020-8558
         </a>
         ,
        was recently discovered in Kubernetes. Services sometimes communicate
        with other applications running inside the same Pod using the local
        loopback interface (127.0.0.1). This vulnerability allows an attacker
        with access to the cluster's network to send traffic to the loopback
        interface of adjacent Pods and nodes. Services that rely on the loopback
        interface not being accessible outside their Pod could be exploited.

          CVE-2020-8559

         ,
        was recently discovered in Kubernetes. This vulnerability allows an
        attacker that has already compromised a node to execute a command in any
        Pod in the cluster. The attacker can thereby use the already compromised
        node to compromise other nodes and potentially read information, or
        cause destructive actions.

        <p>
         Note that for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, a node in your
        cluster must have already been compromised. This vulnerability, by itself,
        will not compromise any nodes in your cluster.

         These patches mitigate vulnerability CVE-2020-8559. This is rated as a
        Medium vulnerability for GKE, as it requires the attacker
        to have first hand information about the cluster, nodes, and workloads
        to effectively leverage this attack in addition to an existing
        compromised node. This vulnerability by itself will not provide an
        attacker with a compromised node.

      was recently discovered in Kubernetes, allowing certain authorized

      control plane host network. The Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control
      plane uses controllers from Kubernetes and is thus affected by this

      latest patch version, as we detail below. A node upgrade is not required.

        <p>
         An attacker with permissions to create a Pod with certain
      built-in Volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO) or
      permissions to create a StorageClass can cause
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          kube-controller-manager
         </code>
         to make
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          GET
         </code>
         requests or
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          POST
         </code>
         requests
         <em>
          without
         </em>
         an attacker controlled request
      body from the master's host network. These volume types are rarely used on
      GKE, so new use of these volume types may be a
      useful detection signal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combined with a means to leak the results of the
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          GET/POST
         </code>
         back to the attacker, such as through logs, this can lead to disclosure
      of sensitive information. We have updated the storage drivers in
      question to remove the potential for such leaks.

      which allows any user authorized to make POST requests to execute a remote
      Denial-of-Service attack on a Kubernetes API server. The Kubernetes
      Product Security Committee (PSC) released additional information on this
      vulnerability which can be found

          We recently discovered and mitigated a vulnerability where the RBAC proxy
      used for securing monitoring endpoints did not correctly authorize users.
