      <b>
       #1257:
      </b>
      When Velostrata Prep RPM is installed on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
11, the VM obtains a DHCP IP address in addition to an existing static IP
configuration. This issue occurs when the VM is started on-premises in a subnet
that is enabled with DHCP services.
      <br/>
      Note: The issue does not occur when the subnet has no DHCP services. There is no
connectivity impact for communications with the original static IP address.

      <b>
       #1027:
      </b>
      In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party
VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Velostrata periodic
write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes
the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an
increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
      <br/>
      <b>
       Workaround:
      </b>
      Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the
task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the
Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a
while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the
uncommitted writes.
