    <p>
     Velostrata V4.0 introduces Migration Wave management in the
Velostrata Manager web UI. A Migration Wave is a construct to organize a set of
source virtual machines and their target specifications, using runbooks. With
Migration Waves, administrators can perform and monitor multiple migration
actions on the set without having to upload a Runbook for each action as in
previous versions of Velostrata.

     Known limitations
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      VMware virtual disk consolidation warning: when write-back consistency
checkpoints are persisted in the vSphere Datastore on-premises, a snapshot
rotation and virtual disk consolidation is performed. During consolidation,
the virtual machine has an event showing that its disks require
consolidation. This status is temporary and resolves automatically
when consolidation triggered by Velostrata has completed. A similar
behavior occurs when moving a virtual machine to run back on-premises.
     </li>
     <li>
      Typical storage throughput per virtual disk - Due to vSphere Storage API
limitations, throughput achieved on-premises per VMDK
limited to about 20-30Mbytes/sec. When workloads are highly concentrated
into a single virtual disk, the initial performance seen in the cloud may
be limited due to an increase in storage access latency back on-premises.
This situation typically resolves itself within minutes, as soon as an
active working set is established in the Velostrata cache, in the cloud.
     </li>
     <li>
      Maximum concurrent read sessions per ESX host - Due to vSphere Storage
API limitations, the number of storage access sessions per ESX host is
constrained. For virtual machines that are actively running in the cloud,
Velostrata enforces a limit of up to 60 VMDKs or RDMs per ESX
host. Multiple ESX
hosts may be used. Given that these virtual machines are not actually
executing on the ESX hosts, these hosts can be of minimal specs.
     </li>
     <li>
      Virtual Machine disks in Independent mode (persistent and
non-persistent) and Physical RDM mode are supported with limited
functionality; contact Velostrata Support for details if used.
     </li>
     <li>
      IDE virtual disks are currently not supported. Change the virtual disk
type to SCSI to enable migration to cloud.
     </li>
     <li>
      Free space on source datastore - Write back activity for a VM running in
the cloud is temporarily paused when the vSphere Datastore's
free capacity is lower than 10%, and a vCenter alarm is raised to indicate
of the issue. Write back will resume automatically as space is freed up on
the datastore
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Workaround:
     </strong>
     Monitor the Uncommitted Writes counter and correlate it to
low-disk space events from the vSphere datastore. When write back is put
on-hold, the Uncommitted Writes graph indicates a growing count for longer
periods.

      When Velostrata Prep RPM is installed on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
11, the VM obtains a DHCP IP address in addition to an existing static IP
configuration. This issue occurs when the VM is started on-premises in a subnet
that is enabled with DHCP services.

      In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party
VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Velostrata periodic
write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes
the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an
increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.

      <b>
       Workaround:

      Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the
task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the
Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a
while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the
uncommitted writes.

      In rare cases, when a cloud component instance is created and system
fails before it is tagged, the instance will remain untagged. This will not
allow full clean-up or repair of the CE.
      <br/>
      <b>
       Workaround:
      </b>
      Manually tag the instance, and then run "Repair".
