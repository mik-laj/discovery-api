    All security bulletins for Anthos GKE on-prem are described in this topic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargos until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, GKE on-prem's
    <a href="/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/archive/1.2/release-notes">
     Release Notes
    </a>
    will refer to "security
updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the notes will be
updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.

please pay particular attention to these bulletins. These vulnerabilities are
more likely to impact multi-tenant workloads. For a technical description of

         A vulnerability was recently discovered in Kubernetes, described in

          CVE-2019-11253
         </a>
         ,
      which allows any user authorized to make POST requests to execute a remote
      Denial-of-Service attack on a Kubernetes API server. The Kubernetes
      Product Security Committee (PSC) released additional information on this
      vulnerability which can be found

         We recently discovered and mitigated a vulnerability where the RBAC proxy
      used for securing monitoring endpoints did not correctly authorize users.
      As a result, metrics from certain components are available to unauthorized
      users from within the internal cluster network. The following components
      were affected:

      all Namespaces. This means user and service accounts with only
      namespace-level RBAC permissions can interact with cluster-scoped custom
      resources. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have
      privileges to access the resource in any namespace.
