       Version 4.5 introduces beta support for Azure to Google Cloud migration. You can migrate VMs to Azure using Waves migration. Please note that in this version, a storage account is used per each VM migrated from Azure to Google Cloud, which, pending on the storage account usage in your subscription, may limit the amount of concurrent migration you can do.

        #131614405:
       </strong>
       When the Velostrata Prep RPM is installed on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, the VM obtains a DHCP IP address in addition to an existing static IP configuration. This issue occurs when the VM is started on-premises in a subnet that is enabled with DHCP services.

        #131548730:
       </strong>
       In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Workaround:
       </strong>
       Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.
