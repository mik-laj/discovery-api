       </strong>
       In some cases, when a VM is moved to 
      Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary
      snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will
      not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot.
      The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and
      no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.

       <strong>
        Workaround:
       </strong>
       Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM
      and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes.
      Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many
      pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will
      result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.

       vCenter "Export OVA" operation is available
      when the VM in cloud is running in cache mode, however, this operation
      results in a corrupted OVA.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Workaround:
       </strong>
       Only create OVA after the detach.
