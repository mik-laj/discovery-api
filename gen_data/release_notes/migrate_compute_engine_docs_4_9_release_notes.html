       </strong>
       Windows image from AWS fails to start after migration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Windows images from AWS might fail when running on GCP with the following error message written to the console:
      </p>
      <pre dir="ltr" translate="no">Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:
      1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.
      2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."
      3. Click "Repair your computer."
    If you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance. 
    File: \Windows\system32\DRIVERS\ena.sys 
    Status: 0xc0000428</pre>
      <p>
       This issue is a result of an AWS driver being marked as corrupt when Windows
    starts in a different environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Workaround:

          Backup the system and delete the following file from the source AWS instance:

       </strong>
       In some cases, when a VM is moved to 
      Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary
      snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will
      not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot.
      The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and
      no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.

       <strong>
        Workaround:
       </strong>
       Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM
      and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes.
      Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many
      pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will
      result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.
