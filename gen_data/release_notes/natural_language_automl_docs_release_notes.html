        AutoML Natural Language General Availability (GA) release
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       AutoML Natural Language enables you to train three types of custom machine learning models:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         AutoML Text &amp; Document Classification
        </strong>
        creates models to classify documents according to labels that you define.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         AutoML Text &amp; Document Entity Extraction
        </strong>
        creates models to identify a custom set of entities within documents.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         AutoML Text &amp; Document Sentiment Analysis
        </strong>
        creates models to analyze attitudes within text.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The GA release consolidates these features, which were documented as separate products during beta testing. See the

       Models created during the EAP will continue to be valid for the Beta. You do not need to recreate/retrain models. However, the format of resource IDs (dataset IDs, model IDs, and operation IDs) is changing. If you are using hardcoded resource IDs, you need to obtain new IDs for those resources (using the get or list method) by August 31, 2018.

        Note:

       Enabling the AutoML API for your project automatically also enables the Cloud Vision API, Cloud Translation API, and Cloud Natural Language API. Disabling any of these three APIs will also disable the AutoML API.
