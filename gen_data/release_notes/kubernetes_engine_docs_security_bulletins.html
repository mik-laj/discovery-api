    All security bulletins for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) are described in this topic.

   <p>
    Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargos until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, GKE's
    <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes">
     Release Notes
    </a>
    will refer to "security
updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the notes will be
updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.

      was recently discovered in Kubernetes, allowing certain authorized
      users to leak up to 500 bytes of sensitive information from the
      control plane host network. The Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control
      plane uses controllers from Kubernetes and is thus affected by this
      vulnerability. We recommend that you
         <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-container-cluster">
          upgrade
         </a>
         the control plane to the latest patch version, as we detail below.
      A node upgrade is not required.

        For most customers, no further action is required. The vast
      majority of clusters are already running a patched version.

      The following GKE versions or newer contain the fix for this
      vulnerability:
        <ul>
         <li>

         These patches mitigate vulnerability CVE-2020-8555. This is rated
      as a Medium vulnerability for GKE as it was difficult
      to exploit due to various control plane hardening measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         An attacker with permissions to create a Pod with certain
      built-in Volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO) or
      permissions to create a StorageClass can cause
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          kube-controller-manager
         </code>
         to make
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          GET
         </code>
         requests or
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          POST
         </code>
         requests
         <em>
          without
         </em>
         an attacker controlled request
      body from the master's host network. These volume types are rarely used on
      GKE, so new use of these volume types may be a
      useful detection signal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combined with a means to leak the results of the
         <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
          GET/POST
         </code>
         back to the attacker, such as through logs, this can lead to disclosure
      of sensitive information. We have updated the storage drivers in
      question to remove the potential for such leaks.

          <p>
           For customers who are using Windows Server nodes, both the nodes and

             Kubernetes recently discovered a vulnerability,

             ,
      which allows cluster-scoped
             <a class="external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">
              custom resource
             </a>
             instances to be acted on as if they were namespaced objects existing in
      all Namespaces. This means user and service accounts with only
      namespace-level RBAC permissions can interact with cluster-scoped custom
      resources. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have
      privileges to access the resource in any namespace.

             At the time of our last update, patches for versions 1.11.9 and 1.11.10
      were not yet available. We have now released 1.11.10-gke.5 as an upgrade
      target for both 1.11 versions.
            </p>
            <p>
             At this time, GKE masters have been patched, and the
      Google infrastructure that runs Kubernetes Engine has been patched and is
      protected from this vulnerability.
            </p>
            <p>
             1.11 masters will soon be deprecated and are scheduled to automatically
      upgrade to 1.12 the week of July 8, 2019. You may choose any of the
      following suggested actions to get nodes onto a patched version:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Perform the node upgrade to 1.11.10-gke.5 by Jul 8, 2019. After this
        date, 1.11 versions will begin to be removed from the available list
        of upgrade targets.

              Google is preparing a permanent mitigation for these vulnerabilities that
      will be made available as a new node version. We will update this bulletin
      and send an email to all GKE customers when the
      permanent fix is made available.
             </p>
             <p>
              Until the permanent fix is available, we've created a Kubernetes
      DaemonSet that implements mitigations by modifying the host
              <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
               iptables
              </code>

             </h5>
             <p>
              Apply the Kubernetes DaemonSet to all nodes in your cluster by
      running the following command. This adds an

              </code>
              rules on the node to mitigate the
      vulnerability.
              <strong>
               Run the command once per cluster per Google Cloud
      project.

      setting the value of
              <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
               USER
              </code>
              in a Dockerfile), unexpected
      behavior occurs. When a container runs for the first time on a node, it
      correctly respects the specified UID. However, due to this defect, on the
      second run (and subsequent runs) the container runs as UID 0 regardless of
      the specified UID. This is usually an undesired escalated privilege, and
      can lead to unexpected application behavior.

             <strong>
              For customers running untrusted code in their own
          multi-tenant services within Kubernetes Engine, this is a particularly
          severe vulnerability.
             </strong>
             To mitigate it in Kubernetes Engine,
          disable Hyper-Threading in your nodes. Only Google Kubernetes Engine
          (GKE) nodes using multiple CPUs are affected by these vulnerabilities.
          Note that n1-standard-1 (the GKE default), g1-small and f1-micro VMs
          only expose 1 vCPU to the guest environment so there is no need to
          disable Hyper-Threading.

        We will upgrade masters and nodes with auto-upgrade to the patched

               Disabling Hyper-Threading might have severe performance impact on

               Hyper-threading can be disabled at the GKE node pool level by
            deploying a DaemonSet. However, deploying this DaemonSet will result
            in all of your nodes in the node pool rebooting at the same time.
            Therefore, it is recommended to create a new node pool in your
            cluster, deploy the DaemonSet to disable Hyper-Threading in that
            node pool, and then migrate your workloads to the new node pool.

             <li>
              Deploy the DaemonSet to this new node pool. The DaemonSet will only

            <p>
             You must keep the DaemonSet running on the nodepools so that new nodes

            <p>
             To re-enable Hyper-Threading, you will need to recreate the node pool

       the new node pool.

             The vulnerability CVE-2018-1002105 allows a user with relatively low
        privileges to bypass authorization to the kubelet's APIs. This gives a
        user authorized to make upgradable requests to escalate and make
        arbitrary calls to the kubelet's API. This is rated as a Critical
        vulnerability in Kubernetes. Given some details in GKE's implementation
        that prevented the unauthenticated escalation path, this is rated as a
        High vulnerability.

             Google recently discovered an issue in the Calico Container Network
        Interface (CNI) plugin which can, in certain configurations, log
        sensitive information. This issue is tracked under Tigera Technical
        Advisory

            <ul>
             <li>
              When running with debug-level logging, the Calico CNI plugin will
        write Kubernetes API client configuration into the logs.
             </li>
             <li>
              The Calico CNI will also write the Kubernetes API token to the
        logs at the info level if the "k8s_auth_token" field is set on the CNI
        network configuration.
             </li>
             <li>
              Additionally, when running with debug-level logging, if the
        service account token is explicitly set, either in the Calico
        configuration file read by Calico, or as environment variables used by
        Calico, then Calico components (calico/node, felix, CNI) will write
        this information to the log files.

             Google Kubernetes Engine Clusters with a Cluster Network Policy and

             We have deployed a fix that migrates the Calico CNI plugin to only log
        at the warning level, and use a new service account. The patched calico
        code will be deployed in a later release.

             GKE logs all access to the API server. To determine if a Calico token
        was used from outside Google Cloud's expected IP range, you can run the

              manually upgrade

        Kubernetes 1.8.9-gke.1, and Kubernetes 1.7.14-gke.1. New clusters will
        use the patched version by default by March 30; if you create a new
        cluster before then, you must specify the patched version for it to be
        used.

            <p>
             The patch mitigates the following two vulnerabilities:
            </p>
            <p>
             The vulnerability CVE-2017-1002101 allows containers using
             <a class="external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#using-subpath">
              subpath
             </a>
             volume mounts to access files outside of the volume. This means that if
        you are blocking container access to hostpath volumes with
        PodSecurityPolicy, an attacker with the ability to update or create pods
        can mount any hostpath using any other volume type.
            </p>
            <p>
             The vulnerability CVE-2017-1002102 allows containers using certain
        volume types - including secrets, config maps, projected volumes, or
        downward API volumes - to delete files outside of the volume. This means
        that if a container using one of these volume types is compromised, or
        if you allow untrusted users to create pods, an attacker could use that
        container to delete arbitrary files on the host.
