    All security bulletins for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) are described in this topic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargos until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, GKE's
    <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes">
     Release Notes
    </a>
    will refer to "security
updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the notes will be
updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.

more likely to impact multi-tenant workloads. For a technical description of

        <p>
         For customers who are using Windows Server nodes, both the nodes and
      the containerized workloads that run on those nodes must be updated to
      patched versions to mitigate this vulnerability.

         At the time of our last update, patches for versions 1.11.9 and 1.11.10
      were not yet available. We have now released 1.11.10-gke.5 as an upgrade
      target for both 1.11 versions.
        </p>
        <p>
         At this time, GKE masters have been patched, and the
      Google infrastructure that runs Kubernetes Engine has been patched and is
      protected from this vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
         1.11 masters will soon be deprecated and are scheduled to automatically
      upgrade to 1.12 the week of July 8, 2019. You may choose any of the
      following suggested actions to get nodes onto a patched version:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Perform the node upgrade to 1.11.10-gke.5 by Jul 8, 2019. After this
        date, 1.11 versions will begin to be removed from the available list
        of upgrade targets.
         </li>
         <li>
          Enable

           auto upgrades

      permanent fix is made available.
         </p>
         <p>
          Until the permanent fix is available, we've created a Kubernetes
      DaemonSet that implements mitigations by modifying the host
          <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
           iptables

          configuration.

          What should I do?
         </h5>
         <p>
          Apply the Kubernetes DaemonSet to all nodes in your cluster by
      running the following command. This adds an
          <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
           iptables
          </code>
          rule to
      the existing
          <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
           iptables
          </code>
          rules on the node to mitigate the
      vulnerability.
          <strong>
           Run the command once per cluster per Google Cloud
      project.
          </strong>
         </p>

         <p>
          Once a patched node version is available and you have upgraded all

           CVE-2019-11245
          </a>
          in kubelet v1.13.6 and v1.14.2, which can cause containers to run as UID 0
      (typically maps to the
          <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
           root
          </code>
          user), even if a different user
      is specified in the container image.

           If your containers run as a non-root
      user and you are running node version 1.13.6-gke.0 through 1.13.6-gke.6,

           <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
            RunAsUser
           </code>
           on all Pods in the cluster

      correctly respects the specified UID. However, due to this defect, on the
      second run (and subsequent runs) the container runs as UID 0 regardless of
      the specified UID. This is usually an undesired escalated privilege, and
      can lead to unexpected application behavior.

         To mitigate it in Kubernetes Engine,
          disable Hyper-Threading in your nodes. Only Google Kubernetes Engine

           Hyper-threading can be disabled at the GKE node pool level by
            deploying a DaemonSet. However, deploying this DaemonSet will result
            in all of your nodes in the node pool rebooting at the same time.
            Therefore, it is recommended to create a new node pool in your
            cluster, deploy the DaemonSet to disable Hyper-Threading in that
            node pool, and then migrate your workloads to the new node pool.
          </li>
         </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
         To create a new node pool with Hyper-Threading disabled:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Create a new node pool in your cluster with the node label
          <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
           cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=true
          </code>
          :

gcloud container node-pools create smt-disabled --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME] \
    --node-labels=cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=true</pre>
         </li>
         <li>
          Deploy the DaemonSet to this new node pool. The DaemonSet will only
          run on nodes with the
          <code dir="ltr" translate="no">
           cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=true

       creations can be triggered by node auto repair, manual or auto upgrade,
       and auto-scaling.
        </p>
        <p>
         To re-enable Hyper-Threading, you will need to recreate the node pool
       without deploying the provided DaemonSet, and migrate your workloads to
       the new node pool.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also recommend that you manually upgrade your nodes once the patch becomes
      available. In order to upgrade, you must first
         <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-cluster#upgrading_the_cluster">
          upgrade your master
         </a>
         to the newest version. GKE masters will automatically be upgraded at
      the regular upgrade cadence.

        <p>
         We will update this bulletin with the versions containing a patch once available.

         Google recently discovered an issue in the Calico Container Network
        Interface (CNI) plugin which can, in certain configurations, log

        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          When running with debug-level logging, the Calico CNI plugin will
        write Kubernetes API client configuration into the logs.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Calico CNI will also write the Kubernetes API token to the
        logs at the info level if the "k8s_auth_token" field is set on the CNI
        network configuration.
         </li>
         <li>
          Additionally, when running with debug-level logging, if the
        service account token is explicitly set, either in the Calico
        configuration file read by Calico, or as environment variables used by
        Calico, then Calico components (calico/node, felix, CNI) will write
        this information to the log files.

         Google Kubernetes Engine Clusters with a Cluster Network Policy and

        Stackdriver. Clusters without Network Policy enabled are unaffected.

        <p>
         We have deployed a fix that migrates the Calico CNI plugin to only log
        at the warning level, and use a new service account. The patched calico
        code will be deployed in a later release.

         Over the course of the next week, we will perform a rolling revocation

         GKE logs all access to the API server. To determine if a Calico token
        was used from outside Google Cloud's expected IP range, you can run the
        following Stackdriver query. Please note this will only return records

        needed for your specific environment.

        you sooner based on the zone your cluster is in, according to the
         <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#march-12-2018">
          release schedule
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to upgrade, you must first upgrade your master to the newest
        version. This patch will be available in Kubernetes 1.9.4-gke.1,
        Kubernetes 1.8.9-gke.1, and Kubernetes 1.7.14-gke.1. New clusters will
        use the patched version by default by March 30; if you create a new
        cluster before then, you must specify the patched version for it to be
        used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Kubernetes Engine customers who have
         <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-auto-upgrades">
          node auto-upgrades
         </a>
         enabled and who do not manually upgrade will have their nodes upgraded
        to patched versions by April 23rd. However, due to the nature of the
        vulnerability, we recommend you
         <a href="/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-container-cluster">
          manually upgrade
         </a>
         your nodes as soon as the patch is available to you.

         What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch?

        <p>
         The patch mitigates the following two vulnerabilities:
        </p>
        <p>
         The vulnerability CVE-2017-1002101 allows containers using
         <a class="external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#using-subpath">
          subpath
         </a>
         volume mounts to access files outside of the volume. This means that if
        you are blocking container access to hostpath volumes with
        PodSecurityPolicy, an attacker with the ability to update or create pods
        can mount any hostpath using any other volume type.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vulnerability CVE-2017-1002102 allows containers using certain
        volume types - including secrets, config maps, projected volumes, or
        downward API volumes - to delete files outside of the volume. This means
        that if a container using one of these volume types is compromised, or
        if you allow untrusted users to create pods, an attacker could use that
        container to delete arbitrary files on the host.
