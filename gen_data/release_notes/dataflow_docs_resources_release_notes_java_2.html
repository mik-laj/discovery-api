      NOTE:

     Cloud Dataflow SDK 2.x releases have a number of significant changes from the
1.x series of releases. See the changes in the

      Apache Software Foundation
     </a>
     as part of the
     <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">
      Apache Beam
     </a>
     project. The Dataflow SDKs are
now based on Apache Beam.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dataflow SDK for Java 2.0.0 is the first stable 2.x release of the Dataflow
SDK for Java, based on a subset of the Apache Beam code base. For information

      Warning for users upgrading from Dataflow SDK for Java 1.x:

     This is a new major version, and therefore comes with the following caveats.

     <b>
      Breaking Changes:
     </b>
     The Dataflow SDK 2.x for Java has a number of breaking
      changes from the 1.x series of releases. Please see below for details.
     <br/>
     *
     <b>
      Update Incompatibility:
     </b>
     The Dataflow SDK 2.x for Java is
      update-incompatible with Dataflow 1.x. Streaming jobs using a Dataflow 1.x SDK
      cannot be updated to use a Dataflow 2.x SDK. Dataflow 2.x pipelines may only be
      updated across versions starting with SDK version 2.0.0.

     Cloud Dataflow SDK distribution contents
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Dataflow SDK distribution contains a subset of the Apache Beam ecosystem.
This subset includes the necessary components to define your pipeline and execute it
locally and on the Dataflow service, such as:
     <ul>
      <li>
       The core SDK
      </li>
      <li>
       DirectRunner and DataflowRunner
      </li>
      <li>
       I/O components for other Google Cloud Platform services
      </li>
      <li>
       Apache Kafka
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dataflow SDK distribution
     <b>
      does not
     </b>
     include other Beam
components, such as:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Runners for other distributed processing engines (such as Apache Spark
    or Apache Flink)
      </li>
      <li>
       I/O components for non-Cloud Platform services that are not explicitly
  listed above
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     If your use case requires any components that are not included, you can use the
appropriate Apache Beam modules directly and still run your pipeline on the
Dataflow service.
