       Previously, the date planned for this decommissioning was March 25, 2019, but in response to
  customer requests, we are extending this timeline. The new end date has yet to be finalized but is
  expected to happen in 2019. When decommissioning happens, you will no longer be able to submit new
  Dataflow jobs or update running Dataflow jobs that use the
  decommissioned SDKs. In addition, existing streaming jobs that use these SDK versions may fail.

        Dataflow SDK Deprecation Notice:
       </strong>
       The
  Dataflow SDK 2.5.0 is the last Dataflow SDK
  release that is separate from the Apache Beam SDK releases. The
  Dataflow service supports official Apache Beam SDK
  releases as documented in the

      NOTE:

     Cloud Dataflow SDK 2.x releases have a number of significant changes from the
1.x series of releases. See the changes in the
     <a href="/dataflow/docs/guides/migrate-java-1-to-2">

     In January 2016, Google announced the donation of the Dataflow SDKs to the
     <a href="http://www.apache.org/">
      Apache Software Foundation
     </a>
     as part of the
     <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">
      Apache Beam
     </a>
     project. The Dataflow SDKs are
now based on Apache Beam.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dataflow SDK for Java 2.0.0 is the first stable 2.x release of the Dataflow
SDK for Java, based on a subset of the Apache Beam code base. For information
about version 1.x of the Dataflow SDK for Java, see the

      Warning for users upgrading from Dataflow SDK for Java 1.x:

      Breaking Changes:
     </b>
     The Dataflow SDK 2.x for Java has a number of breaking
      changes from the 1.x series of releases. Please see below for details.
     <br/>
     *
     <b>
      Update Incompatibility:
     </b>
     The Dataflow SDK 2.x for Java is
      update-incompatible with Dataflow 1.x. Streaming jobs using a Dataflow 1.x SDK
      cannot be updated to use a Dataflow 2.x SDK. Dataflow 2.x pipelines may only be
      updated across versions starting with SDK version 2.0.0.

     Cloud Dataflow SDK distribution contents
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Dataflow SDK distribution contains a subset of the Apache Beam ecosystem.
This subset includes the necessary components to define your pipeline and execute it
locally and on the Dataflow service, such as:
     <ul>
      <li>
       The core SDK
      </li>
      <li>
       DirectRunner and DataflowRunner
      </li>
      <li>
       I/O components for other Google Cloud Platform services
      </li>
      <li>
       Apache Kafka
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dataflow SDK distribution
     <b>
      does not
     </b>
     include other Beam
components, such as:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Runners for other distributed processing engines (such as Apache Spark
    or Apache Flink)
      </li>
      <li>
       I/O components for non-Cloud Platform services that are not explicitly
  listed above
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     If your use case requires any components that are not included, you can use the
appropriate Apache Beam modules directly and still run your pipeline on the
Dataflow service.
