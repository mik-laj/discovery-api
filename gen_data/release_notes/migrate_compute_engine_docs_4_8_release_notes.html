        #131548730:
       </strong>
       In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Workaround:
       </strong>
       Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.

       Linux versions running with kernel version 2.6.32 may experience a kernel panic on ephemeral storage access failures; these are more likely while streaming over iSCSI.

       In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.

Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.

       Linux versions running with kernel version 2.6.32 may experience a kernel panic on ephemeral storage access failures; these are more likely while streaming over iSCSI.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Workaround
       </strong>
       : Upgrade your kernel. The issue will also reduce in likelihood after Detach.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Workaround:
       </strong>
       Disable the affecting service while migrating and reinstall after Detach.

       </strong>
       Allow the system to finish Windows update and/or suspend Windows updates before migrating.

       Scenario: When moving a VM back on-prem with "force" flag, failure to consolidate snapshot will cause the VM to remain as managed by Velostrata. RunInCloud on the same VM may fail since it is not allowed on managed VMs.
