now correctly validate the alphabet of the value being transformed to match
the transformations alphabet, now correctly rejecting values with whitespace,
when whitespace is not part of the alphabet. Invalid requests will return an
error in the ` TransformationSummary ` with the message
"CryptoReplaceFfxFpeConfig's 'alphabet' does not include all the characters in
the value being transformed; the set of distinct characters in any given value
being transformed by this transformation must be a subset of the set of
characters comprising the 'alphabet'."

##  October 25, 2018

Added support to Cloud Storage [ ` FileSet `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectJobConfig#fileset)
for using regular expression filters to specify which files to include or
exclude from the scan. This is useful for cases where the set of files to scan
cannot be concisely expressed with a path and wildcards, such as:

  * Scan all files, but skip some specific files or folders that you are confident have no sensitive data. 
  * Scan only files whose endings are in some known set of file extensions - for example, only .txt, .csv, and .json files. 
  * Scan only files whose endings aren't in some known set of extensions - for example, skip .pdf files. 

##  September 19, 2018

**FEATURE:**

Added support for [ augmenting existing infoType detectors
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-custom-infotypes-rules) using
exclusion rules and hotword rules.

now scan for dictionaries containing up to tens of millions of entries.

**FEATURE:**

Added support to [ ` CloudStorageOptions `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectJobConfig#cloudstorageoptions)
for limiting the number of bytes to scan per file by percentage.

**FEATURE:**

Added support to [ ` BigQueryOptions `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectJobConfig#bigqueryoptions)
for limiting the number of rows to scan per file by percentage.

##  June 01, 2018

**FEATURE:**

Added support for [ delta-presence estimation
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#privacymetric)
, a risk metric used when membership in the dataset is itself a piece of
sensitive information.

##  May 18, 2018

**FEATURE:**

Added ` sample_method ` flag to [ ` BigQueryOptions `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#bigqueryoptions)
and [ ` CloudStorageOptions `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#cloudstorageoptions)
for limiting scans to a sample of content. This is useful to more efficiently
scan large datasets where the intent is to only determine whether sensitive
data may be located there and the exhaustive list of findings is not
necessary.

##  April 25, 2018

**FEATURE:**

Added ` row_limit ` flag to [ ` BigQueryOptions `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#bigqueryoptions)
to allow for sampling tables instead of scanning all rows.

**FEATURE:**

Dictionaries can now be loaded from files stored in Cloud Storage that consist
of newline-delimited lists of phrases using the ` cloud_storage_path `
parameter in [ ` CustomInfoType.Dictionary `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#google.privacy.dlp.v2.CustomInfoType.Dictionary)
. Useful when sharing dictionaries for custom inspection across multiple
requests.

**FEATURE:**

For customers using Cloud Security Command Center, the summary of a ` DlpJob `
can be published to Cloud SCC using the new action [ ` PublishSummaryToCscc `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#action)
.

been simplified with a [ ` BytesType `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/ByteContentItem#BytesType)
enum to specify the type of data to inspect.

**CHANGED:**

The [ ` Finding `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#google.privacy.dlp.v2.Finding)
object has been expanded with a new [ ` ContentLocation `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rpc/google.privacy.dlp.v2#contentlocation)
to better report findings from various data types (including images, records,
and documents).

new [ ` TimespanConfig `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectJobConfig#TimespanConfig)
, scans can be limited to only re-scanning new or modified content in BigQuery
and Cloud Storage.

**FEATURE:**

](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2beta2/InspectConfig#regex)
-based custom detectors.

**FEATURE:**

Added support for choosing a default [ likelihood
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#likelihood)
for [ ` CustomInfoType `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#custominfotype)
detectors and for adjusting likelihood using a new [ ` DetectionRule `
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#detectionrule)
, which looks for related content within the vicinity of a finding.

**FEATURE:**

Job completion notifications for both risk analysis and inspection can now be
sent to [ Cloud Pub/Sub
](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2beta2/InspectJobConfig#Action)
.

##  December 14, 2017

**FEATURE:**

Launched the new v2beta2 version of the API, which includes a number of new
and improved features, including templates for persisting de-identification
and inspect configurations, a simplified job API for inspecting storage and
risk analysis, and more.

Tips for migrating:

  * [ ` Content ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.content) API methods now take a single ` ContentItem ` . 
  * [ ` InspectConfig ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig) now has a default likelihood, so when left unset findings below ` POSSIBLE ` will be excluded automatically. 
  * Findings from inspect storage are now always stored in your own BigQuery instance, giving you more control of where your sensitive data is stored. 
  * ` content.redact ` , was deprecated in favor of using [ ` content.deidentify ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.content/deidentify) , for redacting text, and [ ` image.redact ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.image/redact) , for redacting images. 
  * [ ` InspectConfig ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig) now requires at least one [ ` InfoType ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InfoType) or [ ` CustomInfoType ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#custominfotype) . 
  * Long running operations were replaced by [ ` DlpJob ` ](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.dlpJobs#resource-dlpjob) objects for risk analysis and storage inspection. ` inspect.operations.create ` was renamed to ` dataSource.inspect ` . 

##  November 22, 2017
