Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, [ CVE-2020-8555
](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8555) , was recently
discovered in Kubernetes, allowing certain authorized users to leak up to 500
bytes of sensitive information from the control plane host network. The Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control plane uses controllers from Kubernetes and is
thus affected by this vulnerability. We recommend that you upgrade the control
plane to the latest patch version, as we detail below. A node upgrade is not
required.  

####  What should I do?

Anthos GKE on AWS (GKE on AWS) v0.2.0 or newer already includes the patch for
this vulnerability. If you are using a previous version, [ download a new
version of the anthos-gke command line tool ](/anthos/gke/docs/aws/how-
to/prerequisites) and recreate your management and user clusters.

####  What vulnerability is addressed by this patch?

These patches mitigate vulnerability CVE-2020-8555. This is rated as a Medium
vulnerability for GKE as it was difficult to exploit due to various control
plane hardening measures.

An attacker with permissions to create a Pod with certain built-in Volume
types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO) or permissions to create a
StorageClass can cause ` kube-controller-manager ` to make ` GET ` requests or
` POST ` requests _without_ an attacker controlled request body from the
master's host network. These volume types are rarely used on GKE, so new use
of these volume types may be a useful detection signal.

Combined with a means to leak the results of the ` GET/POST ` back to the
attacker, such as through logs, this can lead to disclosure of sensitive
information. We have updated the storage drivers in question to remove the
potential for such leaks.

[ CVE-2020-8555 ](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8555)  
  
##  GCP-2020-006

**Published:** 2020-06-01  
Description  |  Severity  |  Notes  
---|---|---  
  
Kubernetes has disclosed a [ vulnerability
](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91507) that allows a
privileged container to redirect node traffic to another container. Mutual
TLS/SSH traffic, such as between the kubelet and API server or traffic from
applications using mTLS cannot be read or modified by this attack. All Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE) nodes are affected by this vulnerability, and we
recommend that you upgrade to the latest patch version, as we detail below.

####  What should I do?

[ Download the anthos-gke command line tool
](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/aws/how-to/prerequisites) with the
following version or newer and recreate your management and user clusters:

  * aws-0.2.1-gke.7 

Very few containers typically require ` CAP_NET_RAW ` . This and other
powerful capabilities should be blocked by default through [ Anthos Policy
Controller ](/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller) or by
updating your Pod specs:

Drop the ` CAP_NET_RAW ` capability from containers:

  * By using Anthos Policy Controller/Gatekeeper with this [ constraint template ](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/blob/master/library/pod-security-policy/capabilities/template.yaml) and applying it, for example: 
    
        # Dropping CAP_NET_RAW with Gatekeeper
    # (requires the K8sPSPCapabilities template)
    apiversion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
    kind:  K8sPSPCapabilities
    metadata:
      name: forbid-cap-net-raw
    spec:
      match:
        kinds:
          - apiGroups: [""]
          kinds: ["Pod"]
        namespaces:
          #List of namespaces to enforce this constraint on
          - default
        # If running gatekeeper >= v3.1.0-beta.5,
        # you can exclude namespaces rather than including them above.
        excludedNamespaces:
          - kube-system
      parameters:
        requiredDropCapabilities:
          - "NET_RAW"
    

  * Or by updating your Pod specs: 
    
        # Dropping CAP_NET_RAW from a Pod:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: no-cap-net-raw
    spec:
      containers:
        -name: may-container
         ...
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
              -NET_RAW
    

####  What vulnerability is addressed by this patch?

The patch mitigate the following vulnerability:

The vulnerability described in [ Kubernetes issue 91507
](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91507) ` CAP_NET_RAW `
capability (which is included in the default container capability set) to
maliciously configure the IPv6 stack on the node and redirect node traffic to
the attacker controlled container. This will allow the attacker to
intercept/modify traffic originating from or destined for the node. Mutual
TLS/SSH traffic, such as between the kubelet and API server or traffic from
applications using mTLS cannot be read or modified by this attack.
