##  October 18, 2019

**Cloud SQL for MySQL**

**FEATURE:**

Cloud SQL Second Generation MySQL instances have a new high availability (HA)
configuration. The new HA configuration, based on Google's [ Regional Disks
](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#repds) , eliminates replication
lag and, combined with automatic failover, provides isolation from many types
of infrastructure, hardware, and software failures. Regional disks also ensure
that all previously committed database transactions are persisted and
available after failover, right up to the time of the failure.

The new high availability configuration is the default. You can continue to
use the API to create instances with the legacy high availability
configuration (using failover replicas) until the upgrade of existing
instances occurs in early 2020. To learn how high availability now works for
Second Generation MySQL instances, see the [ Overview of the high availability
configuration ](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability) .
To enable high availability on existing instances, or to create new instances
with high availability, see [ Enabling and disabling high availability on an
instance ](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ha#ha-existing) .
