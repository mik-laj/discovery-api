##  August 2020

  * **Feature** : Introduces a new Cloud Volumes [ service type ](/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types) . Cloud Volumes Service provides two service types: CVS and CVS-Performance. The new general-purpose CVS service type is intended for standard workloads, such as file and application shares, secondary storage, and moderate application workloads that need up to 100 MiB/s of performance. The _CVS-Performance service type_ name refers to the service that was previously available as _Cloud Volumes Service_ before the introduction of separate service types. 

  * **Feature** : The CVS service type is available in the following regions: ` us-west1 ` (Oregon), ` us-east1 ` (South Carolina), ` europe-west1 ` (Belgium), ` europe-north1 ` (Finland), and ` southamerica-east1 ` (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). The CVS-Performance service type is available in the ` europe-west4 ` (Netherlands) and ` northamerica-northeast1 ` (Montreal) regions. See [ Regional availability for Cloud Volumes Service ](/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/regional-availability) . 

  * **Feature** : Volumes that use the CVS service type can be backed up to Google Cloud Storage using the API for long-term protection and disaster recovery. See [ Backing up and restoring a cloud volume ](/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/backing-up-and-restoring) . 

  * **Feature** : Volumes that use the CVS-Performance service type can use NFSv4.1 ACLs. See [ Creating and managing NFS volumes ](/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/creating-nfs-volumes) .
