text/docs/context-strength?hl=ja) to provide 'hints' to Cloud Speech-to-Text
when it performs speech recognition. This feature is now in beta.

##  June 18, 2019

**FEATURE:**

Cloud Speech-to-Text now has expanded to a 5 minute limit for [ streaming
recognition ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/streaming-
recognize?hl=ja) . To use streaming recognition with the 5 minute limit, you
must use the [ ` v1p1beta1 ` ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-
text/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.speech.v1p1beta1?hl=ja#speech) API
version.

**FEATURE:**

API.

##  February 20, 2019

**FEATURE:**

[ Data logging ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/data-
logging?hl=ja) is now available for general use. When you enable data logging,
you can reduce the cost of using Cloud Speech-to-Text by allowing Google to
log your data in order to improve the service.

**FEATURE:**

[ Enhanced models ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enhanced-
models?hl=ja) are now available for general use. Using enhanced models can
improve audio transcription results.

**CHANGED:**

Using [ enhanced models ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-
text/docs/enhanced-models?hl=ja) no longer requires you to opt-in for data
logging. Enhanced models are available for use by any transcription requests
for a different [ price ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-
text/pricing?hl=ja) as standard models.

**FEATURE:**

[ Selecting a transcription model ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-
text/docs/transcription-model?hl=ja) is now available for general use. You can
select different speech recognition models when you send a request to Cloud
Speech-to-Text, including a model optimized for transcribing audio data from
video files.

**FEATURE:**

Cloud Speech-to-Text can [ identify different speakers
](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/multiple-voices?hl=ja) present

Time offsets (timestamps) are now available. Set the ` enableWordTimeOffsets `
parameter to true in your request configuration and Cloud Speech-to-Text will
include time offset values for the beginning and end of each spoken word that
is recognized in the audio for your request. For more information, see [ Time
offsets (timestamps) ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-
text/docs/basics?hl=ja#time-offsets) .

**CHANGED:**

Cloud Speech-to-Text has added recognition support for 30 new languages. For a
complete list of all supported languages, see the [ language support reference
](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages?hl=ja) .

**CHANGED:**

The limit on the length of audio that you can send with an asynchronous
recognition request has been increased from ~80 to ~180 minutes. For
information on Cloud Speech-to-Text limits, see the [ quotas & limits
](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas?hl=ja) . For more information
on asynchronous recognition requests, see the [ transcribing long audio files
guide ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/async-recognize?hl=ja) .

##  April 18, 2017

**FEATURE:**

Release of Cloud Speech-to-Text v1.

**CHANGED:**

The ` v1beta1 ` release of Cloud Speech-to-Text has been deprecated. The `
v1beta1 ` endpoint continues to be available for a period of time as defined
in the [ terms of service ](https://cloud.google.com/terms?hl=ja) . To avoid
being impacted when the ` v1beta1 ` is discontinued, replace references to `
v1beta1 ` in your code with ` v1 ` and update your code with valid ` v1 ` API
names and values.

**CHANGED:**

A ` language_code ` is now required with requests to Cloud Speech-to-Text.
Requests with a missing or invalid ` language_code ` will return an error.
(Pre-release versions of the API used ` en-US ` if the ` language_code ` was
omitted from the request.)

**CHANGED:**

` SyncRecognize ` is renamed to ` Recognize ` . ` v1beta1/speech:syncrecognize
` is renamed to ` v1/speech:recognize ` . The behavior is unchanged.

**CHANGED:**

The ` sample_rate ` field has been renamed to ` sample_rate_hertz ` . The
behavior is unchanged.

**CHANGED:**

The ` EndpointerType ` enum has been renamed to ` SpeechEventType ` .

The following ` SpeechEventType ` enums have been removed.

  * ` START_OF_SPEECH `
  * ` END_OF_SPEECH `
  * ` END_OF_AUDIO `

**CHANGED:**

The ` END_OF_UTTERANCE ` enum has been renamed to ` END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE `
. The behavior is unchanged.

**CHANGED:**

The ` result_index field ` has been removed.

**CHANGED:**

The ` speech_context ` field has been replaced by the ` speech_contexts `
field, which is a repeated field. However, you can specify, at most, one
speech context. The behavior is unchanged.

**CHANGED:**

The ` SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE ` and ` OGG_OPUS ` codecs have been added to
support audio encoder implementations for legacy applications. We do not
recommend using lossy codes, as they result in a lower-quality speech
transcription. If you must use a low-bitrate encoder, ` OGG_OPUS ` is
preferred.

**CHANGED:**

You are no longer required to specify the encoding and sample rate for WAV or
FLAC files. If omitted, Cloud Speech-to-Text automatically determines the
encoding and sample rate for WAV or FLAC files based on the file header. If
you specify an encoding or sample rate value that does not match the value in
the file header, then Cloud Speech-to-Text will return an error. This change
is backwards-compatible and will not invalidate any currently valid requests.
