###  New Features

**FEATURE:**

You can now run Container Engine clusters in region ` asia-south1 ` (Mumbai).

###  Fixes

**FIXED:**

Clusters using the [ Container-Optimized OS ](/container-optimized-os) [ node
image ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-images) version ` cos-stable-61
` can be affected by Docker daemon crashes and restarts and become unable to
schedule pods.

To mitigate this issue, clusters running Kubernetes versions 1.6.x, 1.7.x, and
1.8.x are slated to automatically upgrade to versions 1.6.11-gke.0,
1.7.8-gke.0, and 1.8.1-gke.1 respectively. These versions have been remapped
to use the ` cos-stable-60-9592-90-0 ` node image.

Automatic upgrades must be enabled for this workaround to take effect. If your
cluster does not have auto-upgrades enabled, you must manually upgrade your
cluster to the appropriate version to employ the workaround.

###  Known Issues

**ISSUE:**

Clusters running Kubernetes version 1.7.6 might see inaccurate memory usage
metrics for pods running on the cluster. Clusters are slated to automatically
upgrade to version 1.7.8-gke.0 to mitigate this issue. If node auto-upgrades
are not enabled for your cluster, you can manually upgrade to 1.7.8-gke.0.

vulnerability, see the associated [ Kubernetes Security Announcement
](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/kubernetes-
dev/QWIzhD3JhhE/AllfBkKLAwAJ) .

###  Known Issues

**ISSUE:**

**Kubernetes 1.8.0-gke.0** (early access and alpha clusters only): Clusters
created with a subnetwork with an automatically-generated name that contains a
hash (e.g. "default-38b01f54907a15a7") might encounter issues where their [
internal load balancers ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/internal-load-balancing)
fail to sync.

This issue also affects clusters that run [ legacy networks
](/compute/docs/vpc/legacy) .

**ISSUE:**

Container Engine clusters can enter a bad state if you convert your
automatically-configured network to a manually-configured one. In this state,
[ internal load balancers ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/internal-load-balancing)
might fail to sync, and node pool upgrades might fail.

##  September 27, 2017

###  New Features

**FEATURE:**

Starting in Kubernetes version 1.7.6, the available resources on cluster nodes
have been updated to account for the CPU and memory requirement of Kubernetes
node daemons. See the [ Node documentation ](/kubernetes-
engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture#nodes) in the [ cluster architecture
overview ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture) for more
information.

**FEATURE:**

You can now [ set a cluster network policy ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/network-
policy) on your Container Engine clusters running Kubernetes version 1.7.6 or
later.

###  Other Updates

**CHANGED:**

The deprecated ` container-vm ` node image type has been removed from the list
of valid Container Engine node images. Existing clusters and node pools will
continue to function, but you can no longer create new clusters and node pools
that run the ` container-vm ` node image.

**ISSUE:**

Clusters that use the deprecated ` container-vm ` as a node image cannot be
upgraded to Kubernetes v1.7.6 or later.

##  August 28, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.7.4 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v174) is available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades. 

  * [ Kubernetes v1.6.9 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v169) is available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades. 

  * Clusters with a master version of v1.6.7 and [ Node Auto-Upgrades ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrades) enabled will have nodes upgraded to v1.6.7. 

  * Clusters with a master version of v1.7.3 and [ Node Auto-Upgrades ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrades) enabled will have nodes upgraded to v1.7.3. 

  * Starting at version v1.7.4, when Cloud Monitoring is enabled for a cluster, [ container system metrics ](/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-container) will start to be pushed by Heapster to Stackdriver Monitoring API. The metrics remain free, though Stackdriver Monitoring API quota will be affected. 

  * Clusters running Kubernetes v1.6.9 and v1.7.4 have updated node images: 

    * The COS node image was upgraded from ` cos-stable-59-9460-73-0 ` to ` cos-stable-60-9592-84-0 ` . Please see the [ COS image release notes ](/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes) for details. 
      * The new COS image includes an upgrade of Docker, from v1.11.2 to v1.13.1. This Docker upgrade contains many stability and performance fixes. A full list of the Docker features that have been deprecated between v1.11.2 and v1.13.1 is available on [ Docker's website ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/) . 
      * Three features in Docker v1.13.1 are disabled by default in the COS m60 image, but are planned to be enabled in a later node image release: live-restore, shared PID namespaces and overlay2. 
      * **Known issue** : Docker v1.13.1 supports [ HEALTHCHECK ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) , which was previously ignored by Docker v1.11.2 on COS m59. Kubernetes supports more powerful liveness/readiness checks for containers, and it currently does not surface or consume the ` HEALTHCHECK ` status reported by Docker. We encourage users to disable ` HEALTHCHECK ` in Docker images to reduce unnecessary overhead, especially if performance degradation is observed after node upgrade. Note that ` HEALTHCHECK ` could be inherited from the base image. 
    * Ubuntu node image was upgraded from [ ` ubuntu-gke-1604-xenial-v20170420-1 ` ](https://storage.googleapis.com/ubuntu-os-gke-cloud/ubuntu-xenial-amd64-gke-20170420.1.manifest) to [ ` ubuntu-gke-1604-xenial-v20170816-1 ` ](https://storage.googleapis.com/ubuntu-os-gke-cloud/ubuntu-xenial-amd64-gke-20170816.1.manifest) . 
      * This patch release is based on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. 
      * It includes a fix for the Stackdriver Logging issues in ` ubuntu-gke-1604-xenial-v20170420-1 ` . 
      * **Known issue** : [ Alias IPs ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases) is not supported. 
  * **Known Issues upgrading to v1.7:**

There is a known issue with StatefulSets in 1.7.X that causes StatefulSet pods
to become unavailable in DNS upon upgrade. We are currently recommending that
you not upgrade to 1.7.X if you are using DNS with StatefulSets. A fix is
being prepared. Additional information can be found here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48327

  * **Known Issues running Docker v1.13:**

Docker v1.13.1 supports [ HEALTHCHECK
](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) , which was
previously ignored by Docker v1.11.2 on COS m59. Kubernetes supports more
powerful liveness/readiness checks for containers, and it currently does not
surface or consume the ` HEALTHCHECK ` status reported by Docker. We encourage
users to disable ` HEALTHCHECK ` in Docker images to reduce unnecessary
overhead, especially if performance degradation is observed after node
upgrade. Note that ` HEALTHCHECK ` could be inherited from the base image.

##  August 21, 2017

  * When using IP aliases, you can now represent service CIDR blocks by using a secondary range instead of a subnetwork. This means you can use IP aliases without specifying the ` --create-subnetwork ` option. 
  * Cluster etcd fragmentation/compaction fixes. 

  * **Known Issues upgrading to v1.7.3:**

There is a known issue with StatefulSets in 1.7.X regarding annotations, so we
are currently recommending that you not upgrade to 1.7.X if you are using
them. A fix is being prepared. Additional information can be found here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48327

##  August 14, 2017

  * Cluster masters running Kubernetes versions 1.7.X will be upgraded to [ v1.7.3 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v173) according to the following schedule: 

    * 2017-08-15: europe-west2-a us-east1-d 
    * 2017-08-16: asia-east1-a asia-northeast1-a asia-southeast1-a australia-southeast1-a europe-west1-c europe-west3-a us-central1-b us-east4-b us-west1-a

  * You can now specify a minimum CPU size/class for Alpha clusters by using the ` --min-cpu-platform ` flag with ` gcloud alpha container ` commands. 

  * Cluster resize commands ( ` gcloud alpha container clusters resize ` or ` gcloud beta container clusters resize ` ) now safely drain nodes before removal. 

  * Updated Google Container Engine's kubectl from version 1.7.2 to 1.7.3. 

  * Added ` --logging-service ` flag to ` gcloud beta container clusters update ` . This flag controls the enabling and disabling of Stackdriver Logging integration. Use ` --logging-service=logging.googleapis.com ` to enable and ` --logging-service=none ` to disable. 

  * Modified the ` --scopes ` flag in ` gcloud beta container clusters create ` and ` gcloud beta container node-pools create ` commands to default to ` logging.write,monitoring ` and support passing an empty list. 

##  August 7, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.7.3 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v173) is available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades. 

  * [ Kubernetes v1.6.8 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v168) is available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades. 

  * Cluster masters running Kubernetes version v1.6.6 or older will be upgraded to [ v1.6.7 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v167) according to the following schedule: 

    * 2017-08-08: europe-west2-a us-east1-d 
    * 2017-08-09: asia-east1-a asia-northeast1-a asia-southeast1-a australia-southeast1-a europe-west1-c europe-west3-a us-central1-b us-east4-b us-west1-a

  * Node pools can now be created with an initial node count of 0. 

  * Cloud monitoring can only be enabled in clusters that have monitoring scope enabled in all node pools. 

  * **Known Issues upgrading to v1.6.7:**

    * Kubernetes 1.6.7 includes version 0.9.5 of the GCP Ingress Controller. This version contains a fix for a bug that caused the controller to incorrectly synchronize GCP URL Maps. Changes to the ingress resource may not have caused the GCP URL Map to update. Using the fixed controller will ensure maps reflect the host and path rules. To avoid potential disruption, validate that all ingress objects contain the desired ` host ` or ` path ` rules. 

##  August 3, 2017

  * Users with access to Kubernetes [ Secret ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret) objects can no longer view the secrets' values in Google Container Engine UI. The recommended way to access them is with the ` kubectl ` tool. 

##  August 1, 2017

  * The VM firewall rule (e.g. ` cluster-<hash>-vms ` ) for non-legacy auto-mode networks now includes both the primary and reserved VM ranges (10.128/9) if the primary range lies outside of the reserved range. 

  * You can now use the beta Ubuntu node image with clusters running Kubernetes version 1.6.4 or higher. 

  * You can now run Container Engine clusters in region ` europe-west3 ` (Frankfurt). 

##  July 26, 2017

  * You can now use the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to add additional zones to, or remove zones from, your existing multi-zone clusters. For more information, see [ Multi-Zone Clusters ](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/multi-zone-clusters) . 
  * You can now use the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to define [ Master Authorized Networks ](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/authorized-networks) \- a restricted range of IP addresses that are permitted to access your container cluster's Kubernetes master endpoint. 

##  July 25, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.7.2 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v172) is available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades. 

  * **Known Issues upgrading to v1.7.2:**

    * If you are upgrading nodes from 1.7.0 or 1.7.1 to 1.7.2, you may experience service disruption if you have services of type=LoadBalancer. To mitigate this potential disruption, see the [ upgrade instructions for versions 1.7.0 and 1.7.1 ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/upgrade-notice-1-7-2) . 
  * [ Kubernetes v1.6.7 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v167) is the default version for new clusters, released according to the following schedule: 

    * 2017-07-25: us-east1-d europe-west2-a 
    * 2017-07-26: europe-west1-c us-central1-b us-west1-a asia-east1-a asia-northeast1-a asia-southeast1-a us-east4-b australia-southeast1-a

  * You can now use HTTP re-encryption through Google Cloud Load Balancing to allow HTTPS access from the GCP Load Balancer to your service backend. This feature ensures that your data is fully encrypted in all phases of transit, even after it enters Google's global network. 

  * Support for all-private IP (RFC-1918) addresses is generally available. These addresses allow you create clusters and access resources in all-private IP ranges, and extends your ability to use Container Engine clusters with existing networks. 

  * Support for external source IP preservation is now generally available. This feature allows applications to be fully aware of client IP addresses for Kubernetes services you expose. 

  * Cluster autoscaler now supports for scaling node pools to 0 or 1, for when you don't need capacity. 

  * Cluster autoscaler can now use a pricing-based expander, which applies additional cost-based constraints to let you use auto-scaling in the most cost-effective manner. This is default as of 1.7.0 and is not user-configurable. 

  * Cluster autoscaler now supports balanced scale-outs of similar node groups. This is useful for clusters that span multiple zones. 

  * You can now use API Aggregation to extend the Kubernetes API with custom APIs. For example, you can now add existing API solutions such as service catalog, or build your own. 

  * The following new features are available on Alpha clusters running Kubernetes version 1.7: 

    * Local storage 
    * External webhook admission controllers 
  * **Known Issues with v1.7.0:**

    * Kubelet certificate rotation is not enabled for Alpha clusters. This issue will be fixed in a future release. 
    * Kubernetes services with network load balancers using static IP will cause the kube-controller-manager to crash loop, leading to multiple master repairs. See issue [ #48848 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48848) for more details. This issue will be fixed in a future release. 

##  July 10, 2017

  * You can now disable basic authentication for new clusters using the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) . 

  * You can now disable client certificate generation for new clusters using the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) . 

##  June 26, 2017

  * **Known Issues with v1.6.6** A bug in the version of fluentd bundled with Kubernetes [ v1.6.6 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v166) causes JSON-formatted logs to be exported as plain text. This issue will be fixed in v1.6.7. Meanwhile v1.6.6 will remain available as an optional version for new cluster creation and opt-in master upgrades, but will not be made the default. See issue [ #48018 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48108) for more details. 
  * There will be no release for the week of July 3rd, since this is a holiday in the US. The next release is planned for the week of July 10th. 

##  June 20, 2017

  * You can now use [ v1.6.6 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v166) for creating new clusters. 
  * Original plan to upgrade container cluster masters to 1.6 this week has been postponed due to a bug in the GLBC ingress controller that causes unintentional overwrites of manual health check edits (See [ known issues for v1.6.4 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#known-issues-for-v164) ). This bug is fixed in 1.6.6. 
  * DeleteNodepool now drains all nodes in the pool before deletion.

  * Fixed a bug for clusters at v1.6.0 and above where fluentd pods were mistakenly created on all nodes when logging was disabled. 
  * gcloud ` kubectl ` version is now 1.6.2 instead of 1.6.0. 

##  April 12, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.6.1 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v161) This version will be available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades according to the following planned schedule: 
    * 2017-04-12: us-east1-d asia-northeast1-c 
    * 2017-04-13: europe-west1-c us-central1-b us-west1-a asia-east1-a asia-northeast1-a

##  April 4, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.6.0 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v160) This version will be available for new clusters and opt-in master upgrades according to the following planned schedule: 
    * 2017-04-04: us-east1-d asia-northeast1-c 
    * 2017-04-05: europe-west1-c us-central1-b us-west1-a asia-east1-a asia-northeast1-a 
    * 2017-04-06: us-central1-f europe-west1-b asia-east1-c us-east1-c us-west1-b asia-northeast1-b 
    * 2017-04-07: us-central1-a us-central1-c europe-west1-d asia-east1-b us-east1-b 
  * [ Kubernetes v1.5.6 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v156) is still the default version for new clusters. 
  * [ Container-Optimized OS ](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/) is now generally available. You can create or upgrade clusters and node pools that use Container-Optimized OS by specifying ` imageType ` values of either ` COS ` or ` GCI ` . 
  * A new system daemon, node problem detector, is introduced in Kubernetes v1.6 on COS node images. It detects node problems (e.g. kernel/network/container runtime issues) and reports them as node conditions and events. 
  * Starting in 1.6, a default StorageClass instance with the gce-pd provisioner is installed. All unbound PVCs that don't specify a StorageClass will automatically use the default provisioner, which is different behavior from previous releases and can be disabled by modifying the default StorageClass and removing the "storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class annotation". This feature replaces alpha dynamic provisioning, but the alpha annotation will still be allowed and will retain the same behavior. 
  * ` gcloud container clusters create|get-credentials ` will now configure kubectl to use the credentials of the active gcloud account by default, instead of using application default credentials. This requires kubectl 1.6.0 or higher. You can update kubectl by running ` gcloud components update kubectl ` . If you prefer to use application default credentials to authenticate kubectl to Google Container Engine clusters, you can revert to the previous behavior by setting the ` container/use_application_default_credentials ` property: 
    * ` gcloud config set container/use_application_default_credentials true `
    * ` export CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_USE_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS=true `
  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool kubectl version updating to 1.6.0. 
  * New clusters launched at 1.6.0 will use be using etcd3 in the master. Existing cluster masters will be automatically updated to use etcd3 in a future release. 
  * Starting in 1.6, [ RBAC ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) can be used to grant permissions for users and Service Accounts to the cluster's API. To help transition to using RBAC, the cluster's legacy authorization permissions are enabled by default, allowing Kubernetes Service Accounts full access to the API like they had in previous versions of Kubernetes. An option will be rolled out soon to allow the legacy authorization mode to be disabled in order to take full advantage of RBAC. 
  * You can now use gcloud to set or rotate the admin password for Container clusters by running 
    * ` gcloud container clusters update --set-password `
    * ` gcloud container clusters update --generate-password `
  * During node upgrades, Container Engine will now verify and recreate the Managed Instance Group for a node pool (at size 0) if required. 

##  March 29, 2017

##  February 23, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.5.3 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v153) is the default version for new clusters. 
  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool kubectl version updating to 1.5.3. 

##  February 14, 2017

  * It is no longer necessary to disable the HttpLoadBalancing add-on when you create a cluster without adding the compute read/write scope to nodes.  Previously  , when you created a cluster without adding the compute read/write scope, you were required to disable HttpLoadBalacing. 

##  January 31, 2017

  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool kubectl version updating to 1.5.2. 

##  January 26, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.5.2 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v152) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * The ` gcloud ` command-line tool and kubectl 1.5+ support using ` gcloud ` credentials for authentication. Currently, ` gcloud container clusters create ` and ` gcloud container clusters get-credentials ` configure kubectl to use [ Application Default Credentials ](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) to authenticate to Container Clusters. If these differ from the Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) role that the ` gcloud ` command-line tool is using, kubectl requests can fail authentication (# [ 30617 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/30617) ). With Google Cloud SDK 140.0.0 and kubectl 1.5+, the ` gcloud ` command-line tool can configure kubectl to use its own credentials. This means that if, e.g., the ` gcloud ` command-line is configured to use a service account, kubectl will authenticate as the same service account. 

To enable using the ` gcloud ` command-line tool's own credentials, set the `
container/use_application_default_credentials ` property to false:

    
        export CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_USE_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS=false
    # or
    gcloud config set container/use_application_default_credentials false
    

The current default behavior is to continue using application default
credentials. The ` gcloud ` command-line tool credentials will be made the
default for kubectl configuration (via ` gcloud container clusters create|get-
credentials ` ) in a future release.

##  January 17, 2017

  * [ Kubernetes v1.4.8 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v148) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * [ Kubernetes v1.5.2 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v152) is available for new clusters. 

##  January 10, 2017

  * Rollout of Kubernetes v1.5 as the default for new clusters is postponed until v1.5.2 to fix known issues with v1.5.1. 

  * Fixed an issue where Node Upgrades would fail if one of the nodes was not registered with the Master. 

  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool kubectl version updating to 1.5.1. 

**Known Issues with Kubernetes v1.5.1**

  * [ #39680 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/39680) Defining a pod with a resource request of 0 will cause Controller Manager to crashloop.

##  July 11, 2016

  * [ Kubernetes v1.3.0 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v130) is becoming the default version for new clusters. 

  * Existing Google Container Engine cluster masters were upgraded to [ Kubernetes v1.2.5 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/#v125) over the previous week. 

  * Improved error messages when a cluster is already being operated on. 

  * Now supports creating clusters and node pools with local SSDs attached to nodes. See [ Container Cluster Operations ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/clusters/operations#create_a_cluster_with_local_ssd_nodes) for examples. 

  * Cluster autoscaling is now available for clusters running v1.3.0. Autoscaling options can be specified on cluster create and update. See [ Container Cluster Operations ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/clusters/operations#create_a_cluster_with_autoscaling) for examples. 

  * Existing single-zone clusters can now be updated to multi-zone clusters by running ` gcloud beta container clusters update --additional zones ` . See [ Container Cluster Operations ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/clusters/operations#update_a_running_cluster_to_multi_zone) for examples. 

  * **Known issues** : 

    * Scaling v1.3.0 clusters after creation (including via cluster autoscaling) can cause bad routes to be created with colliding target CIDRs. Bad routes can be detected and manually fixed via following 
        
                 * 1. List routes with duplicate destination ranges
         gcloud compute routes list --filter="name ~ gke-$CLUSTER_NAME" --format='value(destRange)' | uniq -d
        

If the above returns any values, the bad routes can be fixed by deleting one
of the target instances. A new one will be automatically recreated with a
working route.

        
                 * 2. Replace $DUPE_RANGE with a destination range from 1.
         gcloud compute routes list --filter="destRange:$DUPE_RANGE"
        
         * 3. Delete one of the target instances listed by 2.
         gcloud compute instances delete $TARGET_INSTANCE
        

    * kubectl authorization for v1.3.0 clusters fails if a the cluster is created with a non-default master auth username ( ` gcloud container clusters create --username ... ` ). This can be worked around by authenticating with the cluster certificate instead by running 

` kubectl config unset users.gke_$PROJECT_$ZONE_$NAME.username `

on the machine from which you want to run ` kubectl ` , where `
$PROJECT,$ZONE,$NAME ` are the cluster's project id, zone and name,
respectively.

##  July 1, 2016

  * Kubernetes [ v1.2.5 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.2.5) is the default version for new clusters.

  * ` gcloud alpha container ` commands (e.g. create) now support specifying alternate ImageTypes, such as the newly-available Beta [ Container-VM Image ](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-image-migration) . To try it out, update to the latest gcloud ( ` gcloud components install alpha ; gcloud components update ` ) and then create a new cluster: ` gcloud alpha container clusters create --image-type=GCI $NAME ` . Support for ImageTypes in Google Cloud Console will follow at a later date. 

  * The ` gcloud container clusters list ` command now sorts the clusters based on zone and then on cluster name.

##  March 21, 2016

  * Kubernetes [ v1.2.0 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.2.0) is the default version for new clusters. This update contains significant changes from v1.1, described in detail at [ releases-1.2.0 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.2.0) . Major changes include 

    * Increased cluster scale by 400% to 1000 nodes with 30,000 pods per cluster. 
    * Kubelet supports 100 pods per node with 4x reduced system overhead. 
    * Deployment and DaemonSet API now Beta. Job and HorizontalPodAutoscaler APIs moved from Beta to GA.

  * Access scopes [ service.management ](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management) and [ servicecontrol ](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol) are now enabled by default for new Container Engine clusters 

  * Clusters created without compute read/write node scopes must also disable [ HttpLoadBalancing ](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters#HttpLoadBalancing) . Note that disabling compute read/write is only possible via the raw API, not the ` gcloud ` command-line tool or the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) . 

  * ClusterUpdates to clusters whose node scopes do not have compute read/write must also specify an AddonsConfig with [ HttpLoadBalancing ](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters#HttpLoadBalancing) disabled. 

  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool ` kubectl ` version updated to 1.2.0. 

##  March 16, 2016

##  February 26, 2016

  * Kubernetes [ v1.1.8 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.1.8) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * DeleteCluster will fail fast with an error if there are backend services that target the cluster's node group, as existence of such services will block deletion of the nodes. 

  * You can now self-initiate an upgrade of a cluster's hosted master to the latest supported Kubernetes version by running ` gcloud container clusters upgrade --master ` . This lets you access versions ahead of automatic Container Engine hosted master upgrades. 

##  February 10, 2016

  * Container Engine hosted master upgrades from v1.1.3, v1.1.4 to v1.1.7 were completed this week. 

  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool ` kubectl ` version is 1.1.7. 

##  January 28, 2016

  * Can now run ` gcloud container clusters resize ` to resize Container Engine clusters. 

  * ` gcloud container clusters ` ` describe ` and ` list ` now notify the user when a node upgrade is available. 

  * ` gcloud ` command-line tool ` kubectl ` version is 1.1.3. 

##  January 5, 2016

  * Fixed an issue where [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) incorrectly disallowed users from creating clusters with Cloud Monitoring enabled. 

  * Fixed an issue where users could not create clusters in domain-scoped projects. 

##  December 8, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v1.1.3 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.1.3) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Added support for custom machine types. 

  * Create cluster now checks that the network for the cluster has a route to the default internet gateway. If no such route exists, the request returns with an error immediately, instead of timing out waiting for the nodes to register. 

  * [ ` gcloud container clusters upgrade ` ](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/upgrade) now prompts for confirmation. 

##  December 3, 2015

  * The Google Container Engine v1beta1 API, which was previously deprecated, is now disabled. 

  * Container Engine hosted masters were upgraded to v1.1.2 this week, except for clusters with nodes older than v1.0.1, which will be upgraded once v1.1.3 is available. 

##  November 30, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v1.1.2 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.1.2) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Container Engine now supports manual-subnet networks. Subnetworks are an Alpha feature of Google Compute Engine and you must be whitelisted to use them. See the [ Subnetworks ](/compute/docs/subnetworks) documentation for whitelist information. 

Once whitelisted, the [ subnetwork ](/compute/docs/subnetworks) is specified
in the cluster create request. In the REST API, this is specified as the value
of the ` subnetwork ` field of the [ cluster object ](/kubernetes-
engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters) ; when using ` gcloud
container ` commands, pass a ` --subnetwork ` flag to [ ` gcloud container
clusters create ` ](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create) .

  * Improved reliability of cluster creation and deletion. 

##  November 18, 2015

  * ` kubectl ` version is 1.1.1. 

  * New API options for disabling the [ HTTP load balancer controller ](/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters#HttpLoadBalancing) and [ horizontal pod autoscaling ](/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters#HorizontalPodAutoscaling) . 

##  November 12, 2015

The release documented below is being rolled out over the next few days.

  * Clusters can now be created with up to 250 nodes. 

  * The Google Compute Engine load balancer controller addon is added by default to new clusters. [ Learn more ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/cluster-loadbalancing/glbc/README.md) . 

  * Kubernetes [ v1.1.1 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.1.1) is the default version for new clusters. 

_Important Note:_ The packaged ` kubectl ` is version 1.0.7, consequently new
Kubernetes 1.1 APIs like autoscaling will not be available via ` kubectl `
until next week's push of the ` kubectl ` binary.

Users who want access before then can manually download a 1.1 ` kubectl `
from:

    * [ Linux ](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.1.1/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl)
    * [ OS X ](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.1.1/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl)

And then ` chmod a+x kubectl; cp kubectl $(which kubectl) ` to install it.

  * Kubernetes v0.19.3 and v0.21.4 are no longer supported for nodes. 

  * New clusters using the ` f1-micro ` machine type must contain at least three nodes. This ensures that there is enough memory in the cluster to run more than just a couple of very small pods. 

  * ` kubectl ` version is 1.0.7. 

##  November 4, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v1.0.7 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.0.7) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Existing clusters will have their masters upgraded from v1.0.6 to v1.0.7 over the coming week. 

  * Added support for [ subnetworks ](/compute/docs/subnetworks#alpha_restrictions) (Alpha). 

##  October 27, 2015

  * Added a ` detail ` field to operation objects to show progress details for long-running operations (such as cluster updates). 

  * Better categorization of errors caused by projects not being fully initialized with the default service accounts. 

##  October 19, 2015

  * The ` --container-ipv4-cidr ` flag has been deprecated in favor of ` --cluster-ipv4-cidr ` . 

  * The current node count of Container Engine clusters is available from the REST API. 

  * Metrics in Cloud Monitoring are now available with a much shorter delay. 

  * Cluster names now only need to be unique within each zone, not within the entire project. 

  * Error messages involving regular expressions have more useful, human-readable hints. 

##  October 12, 2015

  * You can now specify custom metadata to be added to the nodes when creating a cluster with the [ REST API ](/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters/create) . 

##  September 25, 2015

  * Cluster self links now contain the project ID rather than the project number. 

  * ` kubectl ` version is 1.0.6. 

##  September 18, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v1.0.6 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.0.6) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Existing clusters will have their masters upgraded from v1.0.4 to v1.0.6 over the coming week. 

##  September 4, 2015

  * Fixed a bug where a ` CreateCluster ` request would be rejected if it contained a ` ClusterApiVersion ` . Since the field is output-only, it is now silently ignored. 

##  August 31, 2015

  * To avoid creating clusters without any space for non-system containers, there are now limits on clusters consisting of f1-micro instances: 

    * A single-node f1-micro cluster must disable both logging and monitoring. 
    * A two-node f1-micro cluster must disable at least one of logging and monitoring. 

##  August 26, 2015

Google Container Engine is out of beta.

  * All ` gcloud beta container ` commands are now in the ` gcloud container ` command group instead. 

  * You can now use the Google Container Engine API to enable or disable Google Cloud Monitoring on your cluster. Use the [ ` desiredMonitoringService ` field of the cluster update method ](/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters/update) . When updating this field, the Kubernetes apiserver will be see a brief outage as the master is updated. 

##  August 14, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v1.0.3 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.0.3) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * The ` compute ` and ` devstorage.read_only ` auth scopes are no longer required and are no longer automatically added server-side to new clusters. The ` gcloud ` command and Cloud Console still add these scopes on the client side when creating new clusters; the REST API does not. 

  * Listing container clusters in a non-existent zone now results in a ` 404: Not Found ` error instead of an empty list. 

  * The ` get-credentials ` command has moved to ` gcloud beta container clusters get-credentials ` . Running ` gcloud beta container get-credentials ` prints an error redirecting to the new location. 

  * The new ` gcloud beta container get-server-config ` command returns: 

    * The default Kubernetes version currently used for new clusters. 
    * The list of supported versions for node upgrades (via ` gcloud beta container clusters upgrade ` ). 

##  August 4, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v1.0.1 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.0.1) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * ` kubectl ` version is 1.0.1. 

  * Removed the v1beta1 API discovery doc in preparation for deprecation. 

  * The ` gcloud alpha container ` commands target the Container Engine v1 API. The options for ` gcloud alpha container clusters create ` have been updated accordingly: 

    * ` --user ` renamed ` --username ` . 
    * ` --cluster-api-version ` removed. Cluster version not selectable in v1 API; new clusters always created at latest supported version. 
    * ` --image ` option removed. Source image not selectable in v1 API; clusters are always created with latest supported ContainerVM image. Note that using an unsupported image (i.e. not ContainerVM) would result in an unusable cluster in most cases anyway. 
    * Added ` --no-enable-cloud-monitoring ` to turn off cloud monitoring (on by default). 
    * Added ` --disk-size ` option for specifying boot disk size of node VMs. 

##  July 27, 2015

  * A firewall rule is now created at the time of cluster creation to make node VMs accessible via SSH. This ensures that the Kubernetes proxy functionality works. 

  * Updated the admission controllers list to match the [ recommended list for v1.0 ](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/admin/admission-controllers.html#is-there-a-recommended-set-of-plug-ins-to-use) . 

  * Disabled the ` --source-image ` option in the v1beta1 API. Attempting to run ` gcloud alpha container clusters create --source-image ` now returns an error. 

  * Removed the option to create clusters in the 172.16.0.0/12 private IP block.

**Upgrade to Kubernetes v1 - Action Required**

Users must upgrade their configuration files to the v1 Kubernetes API before
August 5th, 2015. This applies to any Beta Container Engine cluster created
before July 21st.

Google Container Engine will upgrade container cluster masters beginning on
August 5th, to use the v1 Kubernetes API. If you'd like to upgrade prior,
please [ sign up for an early upgrade
](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dY4h5uuNwnYOM11k17FqDCnyBXpq7VdFEEkLYG4v7Jk/viewform)
.

This upgrade removes support for the v1beta3 API. All configuration files must
be formatted according to the v1 specification to ensure that your cluster
remains functional. The v1 API represents the production-ready set of APIs for
Kubernetes and Container Engine.

Some helpful resources are:

  * An [ upgrade script ](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/admin/cluster-management.html#switching-your-config-files-to-a-new-api-version) to convert your v1beta3 configuration files to v1. 

  * The official [ v1 specification reference ](http://kubernetes.io/third_party/swagger-ui/) . 

If your configuration files already use the v1 specification, no action is
required.

##  July 15, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v0.21.2 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.21.2) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Existing masters running versions 0.19.3 or higher will be upgraded to 0.21.2. Customers should [ upgrade their container clusters ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/clusters/upgrade) at their convenience. Clusters running versions older than 0.19.3 can not be updated. 

  * The ` kubectl ` version is now 0.20.2. 

##  July 10, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v0.21.1 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.21.1) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * The ` kubectl ` version is now 0.20.1. 

Known issue:

  * The ` rolling-update ` command will fail when using ` kubectl ` v0.20.1 with clusters running v0.19.3 of the Kubernetes API. To resolve the issue, specify ` --api-version=v1beta3 ` as a flag to the ` rolling-update ` command: 
    
        kubectl rolling-update --api-version=v1beta3 --image=<foo> ...
    

To find your version of ` kubectl ` :

    
        kubectl version
    

To find your cluster version:

    
        gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME
    

##  June 25, 2015

  * The Google [ Container Engine REST API ](/kubernetes-engine/reference/rest) has been updated to v1. 

  * The REST API returns a more accurate error message when the region is out of quota. 

  * ` gcloud container clusters create ` supports specifying disk size for nodes with the ` --disk-size ` flag. 

##  June 22, 2015

  * Google Container Engine is now in Beta. 

  * Kubernetes master VMs are no longer created for new clusters. They are now run as a hosted service. There is no Compute Engine instance charge for the hosted master. Read more about [ pricing details ](/kubernetes-engine/pricing) . 

  * Kubernetes [ v0.19.3 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.19.3) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * For projects with default regional Compute Engine CPUs quota, container clusters are limited to 3 per region. 

  * Documentation updated to use ` gcloud beta ` command group. 

  * Documentation updated to use ` apiVersion: v1 ` in all samples. 

Known issue:

  * ` kubectl exec ` is broken for cluster version 0.19.3. 

##  June 10, 2015

  * Documentation updated to use v1beta3. 

  * Kubernetes [ v0.18.2 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.18.2) is the default version for new clusters. 

##  June 3, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v0.18.0 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.18.0) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Clusters launched with 0.18.0 and above are deployed using Managed Instance Groups. 

  * New clusters can no longer be created at v0.16.0. 

  * Fixed a race condition that could cause routes to be leaked on cluster deletion. 

  * Fail faster and with a helpful message if the project is lacking specific resource quota to create a functioning cluster. 

` gcloud ` command-line tool:

  * The ` gcloud alpha container clusters create ` command always sets ` kubectl ` 's current context to the newly created cluster. 

  * The ` clusters create ` and ` get-credentials ` commands look for and write ` kubectl ` configuration to a ` KUBECONFIG ` environment variable. This matches the behavior of ` kubectl config * ` commands. 

  * The ` gcloud alpha container kubectl ` command is disabled. Use simply ` kubectl ` instead. 

##  May 22, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v0.17.1 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.17.1) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Kubernetes v0.16.0 is still supported. However, new clusters can no longer be created at Kubernetes v0.17.0 due to the bug listed below. 

  * Fixes a bug that was preventing containers from accessing the Google Compute Engine metadata service. 

  * Kubernetes service DNS names are now suffixed with ` .<namespace>.svc.cluster.local ` instead of ` .<namespace>.kubernetes.local ` . 

kubectl 0.17.0 notes:

  * Updated ` kubectl cluster-info ` to show v1beta3 addresses. 

  * Add ` kubectl log --previous ` support to view last terminated container log. 

  * Added displaying external IPs to ` kubectl cluster-info ` . 

  * Print container statuses in ` kubectl get pods ` . 

  * Add ` kubectl_label ` to custom functions in bash completion. 

  * Change ` IP ` to ` IP(S) ` in service columns for ` kubectl get ` . 

  * Added ` TerminationGracePeriod ` field to PodSpec and ` grace-period ` flag to ` kubectl stop ` . 

##  May 13, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v0.17.0 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.17.0) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * New clusters can no longer be created at Kubernetes version 0.15.0. 

  * Standalone ` kubectl ` works with Container Engine created clusters without needing to set the ` KUBECONFIG ` env var. 

  * ` gcloud alpha container kubectl ` is deprecated. The command still works, but prints a warning with directions for using ` kubectl ` directly. 

  * Added a new command, ` gcloud alpha container get-credentials ` . The command fetches cluster auth and updates the local ` kubectl ` command. 

  * ` gcloud alpha container kubectl ` and ` clusters delete|describe ` print more helpful error messages when the cluster cannot be found due to an incorrect zone flag/default. 

  * ` gcloud alpha container clusters create ` exits with non-zero returncode if cluster create succeeded but cert data could not be fetched. 

kubectl 0.16.1 notes:

  * Improvements to [ ` kubectl rolling-update ` ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl/rolling-update) . 

  * Default global ` kubeconfig ` location changed to ` ~/.kube/config ` from ` ~/.kube/.kubeconfig ` . 

  * [ ` kubectl delete ` ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl/delete) now stops resources by default (deletes child resources, e.g. pods managed by replication controller). 

  * Flag word separators ` - ` and ` _ ` made equivalent. 

  * Recognize ` .yml ` extension for schema files. 

  * [ ` kubectl get pods ` ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl/get) now prints container statuses. 

  * Simplified loading rules for ` kubeconfig ` (see ` kubectl config --help ` for details). 

  * ` --flatten ` and ` --minify ` options for [ ` kubectl config view ` ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl/config-view) . 

  * Various bugfixes. 

##  May 8, 2015

  * Master VMs are now created with a data persistent disk to store important cluster data, leaving the boot disk for the OS / software. 

##  May 2, 2015

  * Kubernetes [ v0.16.0 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.16.0) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Clusters that don't have nginx will use bearer token auth instead of basic auth. 

  * ` KUBE_PROXY_TOKEN ` added to ` kube-env ` metadata. 

##  April 22, 2015

  * A CIDR can now be requested during cluster creation when using the ` gcloud ` command-line tool or the REST API. For the ` gcloud ` command-line tool, use the ` --container-ipv4-cidr ` flag. If not set, the server will choose a CIDR for the cluster. 

  * Standalone ` kubectl ` instructions are now available from ` gcloud alpha container kubectl --help ` . 

  * When fetching cluster credentials after creating a cluster using the ` gcloud ` command-line tool, you'll never have to enter the passphrase for your SSH key more than once. 

  * The ` gcloud alpha container clusters ... ` commands default to human-readable (table) output. 

##  April 16, 2015

Container Engine:

  * Kubernetes [ v0.15.0 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.15.0) is the default version for new clusters. v0.14.2 is still supported. 

  * The Kubernetes v1beta3 API is now enabled for new clusters. 

  * New clusters can no longer be created at kubernetes version 0.13.2. 

` gcloud ` command-line tool:

  * The ` kubectl ` version is now v0.14.1. 

  * The deprecated ` gcloud alpha container pods|services|replicationcontrollers ` commands have been removed. Use [ ` gcloud alpha container kubectl ` ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl) instead. 

##  April 9, 2015

Container Engine:

  * Kubernetes [ v0.14.2 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases/tag/v0.14.2) is the default version for new clusters. 

  * New clusters can no longer be created at kubernetes version 0.14.1. 

  * Cluster creation is more reliable. 

  * Clusters created via the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) will pre-fill the cluster name with a project-unique name instead of a zone-unique name. 

  * API endpoint no longer included in [ cluster list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list) . 

##  April 2, 2015

Container Engine:

  * Kubernetes v0.14.1 is the default version for new clusters. 

  * New clusters can no longer be created at version 0.11.0. 

  * Container Engine's cluster firewall no longer specifies target-tags. This allows pods to make outgoing connections by default (in the private network). 

` gcloud ` command-line tool:

  * Clusters created by the ` gcloud ` command-line tool now automatically send logs to [ Google Cloud Logging ](/logging/docs) unless explicitly disabled using the ` --no-enable-cloud-logging ` flag. Logs are visible in the [ logs section of the Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/logs) once your project has enabled the Google Cloud Logging API. 

  * You can now access Container Engine clusters with standalone ` kubectl ` (i.e. without ` gcloud alpha container ` ) after setting an environment variable, which is printed after successful cluster creation and/or the first time accessing a cluster with ` gcloud alpha container kubectl ` . 

  * Gcloud will always try to fetch certificate files for the cluster if they are missing. "WARNING: No certificate files found in..." will resolve itself on a subsequent ` gcloud alpha container kubectl ` command run if the cluster is healthy. 

  * Known issue: ` container ` commands are included in the ` alpha ` component, but the kubernetes client ( ` kubectl ` ) is still installed with the ` preview ` component, so users will need both. 

##  April 1, 2015

  * **All Container Engine commands have moved from` gcloud preview ` to ** **` gcloud alpha ` ** . Run ` gcloud components update alpha ` to install this command group. Documentation has been updated to use the ` alpha ` commands. 

##  March 25, 2015

  * Kubernetes v0.13.2 is the default version for new clusters. 

  * The ` kubectl ` version is now v0.13.1. 

  * Updated to ` container-vm-v20150317 ` , which starts up more reliably. 

  * The default boot disk size for cluster nodes has been increased from 10GB to 100GB. 

##  February 25, 2015

` gcloud ` command-line tool:

  * The ` kubectl ` wrapper commands ( ` gcloud preview container pods|services|replicationcontrollers ` ) have been deprecated in favor of using ` gcloud preview container kubectl ` directly. Calling the deprecated commands prints the equivalent ` kubectl ` command. 

  * The ` kubectl ` version has been bumped to 0.11.0. 

  * Fixed a bug that prevented ` kubectl update ` with ` --patch ` from working. 

  * The ` kubectl ` command now automatically tries refetching the configuration if the command fails with a stale configuration error. 

##  February 19, 2015

Google Container Engine:

  * Kubernetes v0.11.0 is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes v0.9.2. 

  * Nodes now use the container-vm-v20150129 image. 

` gcloud ` command-line tool:

  * Pods created with ` gcloud preview container pods create ` no longer bind to a host port. As a result the scheduler can assign more than one pod to each host. 

  * The version of ` kubectl ` used by the ` gcloud preview container kubectl ` command is 0.10.1. 

##  February 12, 2015

  * Kubernetes v0.10.1 is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes v0.10.0. 

  * Improved API enablement flow and error messages when first visiting the Container Engine page of the [ Google Cloud Console ](https://console.cloud.google.com/) . 

##  February 5, 2015

Google Container Engine:

  * Kubernetes v0.10.0 is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes version 0.8.1. 

` gcloud ` command-line tool:

  * The ` gcloud preview container kubectl ` command is upgraded to version 0.9.1: 

    * ` kubectl create ` handles bulk creation from file or directory. 
    * The ` createall ` command has been removed. 
    * Added the ` kubectl rollingupdate ` command, which runs controlled updates of replicated pods. 
    * Added the ` kubectl run-container ` command, which simplifies creation of a (optionally replicated) pod from an image. 
    * Added the ` kubectl stop ` command to cleanly shut down a replication controller. 
    * Added ` kubectl config ... ` commands for managing config for multiple clusters/users. (Note: this is not yet compatible with ` gcloud preview container kubectl ` ). 

Refer to the [ ` kubectl ` reference documentation ](/kubernetes-
engine/docs/kubectl) for more details.

##  January 29, 2015

  * Kubernetes v0.9.2 is the default version for new clusters. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at v0.7.1. Existing clusters at this version can still be used and deleted. 

  * [ SkyDNS ](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns) is supported for services on clusters using v0.9.2 onwards. 

##  January 21, 2015

  * Improved error messages during pod creation when the source image is invalid. 

  * Fixed a bug affecting Compute Engine routes whose ` destRange ` fields are plain IP addresses. 

  * Improved the reliability of cluster creation when provisioning is slow. 

##  January 15, 2015

  * Kubernetes v0.8.1 is the default version for newly created clusters. Our v0.8.1 support includes changes on the 0.8 branch at 0.8.1. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes v0.8.0. Existing clusters at this version can still be used and deleted. 

  * Service accounts and auth scopes can be added to node instances at the time of creation for all pods to use. 

  * The command line interface now renders multiple error messages across newlines and tabs, instead of using a comma separator. 

  * Machine type information has been fixed in the cluster details page of the Google Cloud Console. 

##  January 8, 2015

  * Kubernetes v0.8.0 is the default version for newly created clusters. Kubernetes v0.7.1 is also supported. Refer to the [ Kubernetes release notes ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases) for information about each release. Our v0.7.1 support includes changes on the 0.7 branch at 0.7.1. Our v0.8.0 support includes changes in the 0.7.2 and 0.8.0 releases. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes v0.6.1 and v0.7.0. Existing clusters at these versions can still be used and deleted. 

  * The ` pods|services|replicationcontrollers create ` commands now validate the resource type when creating with ` --config-file ` . This fixes the known issue in the December 12, 2014 release. 

##  December 19, 2014

  * Kubernetes v0.7.0 is the default version for newly created clusters. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes v0.4.4 and v0.5.5. Existing clusters at these versions can still be used and deleted. 

##  December 12, 2014

Known issues:

  * The ` pods|services|replicationcontrollers create ` commands do not validate the resource type when creating with ` --config-file ` . The command creates the resource specified in the configuration file, regardless of the command group specified. For example, calling ` pods create ` and passing a service configuration file creates a service instead of failing. 

Updates:

  * Kubernetes v0.6.1 is the default version for newly created clusters. 

  * Google Container Engine now reserves a /14 CIDR range for new clusters. Previously, a /16 was reserved. 

  * New clusters created with Kubernetes v0.4.4 now use the backports-debian-7-wheezy-v20141108 image. This replaces the previous backports-debian-7-wheezy-v20141021 image. 

  * New clusters created with Kubernetes v0.5.5 or v0.6.1 now use the container-vm image, instead of the Debian backports image. 

  * The [ Service Operations ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/services/operations) documentation has been updated to describe the ` createExternalLoadBalancer ` option. 

  * A new ` gcloud preview container kubectl ` command has been added to the CLI. This is a pass-through command to call the native Kubernetes [ kubectl ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/kubectl) client with arbitrary commands, using the ` gcloud ` command-line tool to handle authentication. 

  * The ` --cluster-name ` flag in all CLI commands has been renamed to ` --cluster ` . 

  * New ` describe ` and ` list ` support for cluster operations. 

##  December 5, 2014

  * The syntax for creating a pod with the Google Container Engine command line interface has changed. The name of the pod is now specified as the value of a ` --name ` flag. See the [ Pod Operations ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/pods/operations) page for details. 

  * Clusters and Operations returned by the API now include a ` selfLink ` field and Operations also include a ` targetLink ` field, which contain the full URL of the given resource. 

  * Added support for Kubernetes v0.4.4 and Kubernetes v0.5.5. The default version is now v0.4.4. Refer to the [ Kubernetes release notes ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases) for information about each release. Our v0.4.4 support includes changes on the 0.4 branch from 0.4.2 through 0.4.4. Our v0.5.5 support includes changes on the 0.5 branch through 0.5.5. 

  * Removed support for creating clusters at Kubernetes v0.4.2. Existing clusters at this version can still be used and deleted. 

##  November 20, 2014

Updates to the ` gcloud preview container ` commands:

  * New error message that catches cluster creation failure due to missing ` default ` network. 

  * Specify default zone and cluster : 
    
        gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
    gcloud config set container/cluster CLUSTER_NAME
    

There is currently a bug preventing the default cluster name from working if
the local configuration cache is missing. If you see a stack trace when
omitting ` --cluster-name ` , repeat the command once with the flag specified.
Subsequent commands can omit the flag.

  * The default cluster name is set to the value of the new cluster when a cluster is successfully created. 

  * The ` gcloud preview container clusters list ` command lists clusters across all zones if no ` --zone ` flag is specified. The ` list ` command ignores any default zone that may be set. 

Documentation updates:

  * A new Getting Started guide has been added: [ Hello Wordpress ](/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-wordpress) . 

Cloud Console updates:

  * Cluster error state information is available in the Cloud Console. 

##  November 4, 2014

_(Updated November 10, 2014: Added two additional known issues with Google_
_Container Engine.)_

Google Container Engine is a new service that creates and manages [ Kubernetes
](http://kubernetes.io) clusters for Google Cloud Platform users.

Container Engine is currently in Alpha state; it is suitable for
experimentation and is intended to provide an early view of the production
service, but customers are strongly encouraged not to run production workloads
on it.

The underlying open source Kubernetes project is being actively developed by
the community and is not considered ready for production use. This version of
Google Container Engine is based on [ Kubernetes public build
](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/releases) v0.4.2. While
the Kubernetes community is working hard to address community-reported issues
as they are reported, there are some known issues in the v0.4.2 release that
will be addressed in v0.5 and that will be incorporated into Google Container
Engine in the coming days.

**Known issues with the Kubernetes 0.4.2 release**

  1. (Issue # [ 1730 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/1730) ) **External health checks that use in-container scripts (exec) do not** **work. Process, HTTP and TCP health checks work properly** . Health checks that use in-container shell execution are not functioning; they always report Unknown. This is a result of the transition to ` docker exec ` introduced in Docker version 1.3. At this time process-level health checks, TCP socket health checks, and HTTP level health checks are functional. This has been addressed in v0.5 and will be available shortly. 

  2. (Issue # [ 1712 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/1712) ) **Pod update operations fails** . In v0.4.2, pod update functionality is not implemented, and a call to the update API returns an unimplemented error. Pods must be updated by tear down and recreate. This will be implemented in v0.5. 

  3. (Issue # [ 974 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/974) ) **Silent failure on internal service port number collision:** Each Kubernetes service needs a unique network port assignment. Currently if you try to create a second service with a port number that conflicts with an existing service, the operation succeeds but the second service will not receive network traffic. This has been fixed, and will be available in v0.5. 

  4. (Issue # [ 1161 ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/1161) ) **External service load balancing** . The current Kubernetes design includes a model that does a 1:1 mapping between an externally-exposed port number at the cluster level, and a service. This means that only a single external service can exist on a given port. For now this is a hard limitation of the service. 

**Known issues with Google Container Engine**

In addition to issues with the underlying Kubernetes project, there are some
known issues with the Google Container Engine tools and API that will be
addressed in subsequent releases.

  1. **Kubecfg binary conflicts:** During the Google Cloud Platform SDK installation, kubecfg v0.4.1 is installed and placed on the path by the Google Cloud SDK. Depending on your $PATH variable, this version may conflict with other installed versions from the open source Kubernetes product. 

  2. **Containers are assigned private IPs in the range** **10.40.0.0/16 to 10.239.0.0/16** . If you have changed your default network settings from 10.240.0.0/16, clusters may create successfully, but fail during operation. 

  3. **All Container Engine nodes are started with and require project level** **read-write scope** . This is temporarily required to support the dynamic mounting of PD-based volumes to nodes. In future releases nodes will revert to default read-only project scope. 

  4. **Windows is not currently supported** . The ` gcloud preview container ` command is built on top of the Kubernetes client's ` kubecfg ` binary, which is not yet available on Windows. 

  5. **The default network is required** . Container Engine relies on the existence of the default network, and tries to create routes that use it. If you don't have a default network, Container Engine cluster creation will fail. 

To recreate it:

    1. Go to the [ Networks page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/networks/list) in the Cloud Console and select your project. 
    2. Click **New network** . 
    3. Enter the following values: 
      * Name: ` default `
      * Address range: ` 10.240.0.0/16 `
      * Gateway: ` 10.240.0.1 `
    4. Click **Create** . 

Next, recreate the firewall rules:

    1. Click ` default ` in the **All networks** list. 
    2. Click **Create new** next to **Firewall rules** . 
    3. Enter the following values: 
      * Name: ` default-allow-internal `
      * Source IP ranges: ` 10.240.0.0/16 `
      * Protocols & ports: ` tcp:1-65535; udp:1-65535; icmp `
    4. Click **Create** . 
    5. Create a second firewall rule with the following values: 
      * Name: ` default-allow-ssh `
      * Source IP ranges: ` 0.0.0.0/0 `
      * Protocols & ports: ` tcp:22 `
