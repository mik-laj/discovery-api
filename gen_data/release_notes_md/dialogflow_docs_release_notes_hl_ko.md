##  April 30, 2020

**FEATURE:**

Beta launch of a one-click integration with a new telephony partner:

  * [ Avaya ](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/avaya?hl=ko)

##  April 25, 2020

**CHANGED:**

In May 2020, the [ Facebook Messenger
](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/facebook?hl=ko)
integration will be updated, and you may notice slight changes related to
fulfillment.

To make sure that your Facebook Messenger bot keeps functioning normally,
observe the following recommendations:

  1. To get the Facebook ` sender.id ` value, use the ` originalDetectIntentRequest.payload.data.sender ` field from the Dialogflow ` WebhookRequest ` message. 
  2. To get the ` source ` field value, use the ` originalDetectIntentRequest.source ` field from the Dialogflow ` WebhookRequest ` message. 
  3. To send rich response messages from your webhook to the Facebook Messenger integration, use the ` WebhookResponse.fulfillment_mesages[].payload ` field. 
  4. In your webhook logic, don’t rely on the fields that are not documented in the official [ Facebook Messenger API ](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/) . 

If you have any questions, reach out to your primary [ support channel
](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/support/getting-support?hl=ko#one-
on-one) .

##  April 20, 2020

**CHANGED:**

When using fulfillment, the ` WebhookResponse.payload ` field can now only be

  * Google Assitant integration custom payload rich response messages. 

For all other [ custom payload rich response messages
](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/intents-rich-messages?hl=ko#custom)
, you should use the ` WebhookResponse.fulfillment_mesages[].payload ` field.

language.

##  January 31, 2020

**FEATURE:**

Beta launch of [ mega agents
](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-mega?hl=ko) to combine
multiple sub-agents agents into a single mega agent.

**DEPRECATED:**

The following [ integrations
](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/?hl=ko) are now
deprecated and will be shut down on ~~April 6th, 2020~~ ~~May 6th, 2020~~ June
6th, 2020 :

  * Kik 
  * Skype 
  * Spark 
  * Twilio IP Messaging 
  * Twilio (Text Messaging)

  * Viber 

Your live bots that use these integrations will stop working unless you take
action. The implementations of these integrations have moved to open source.
To continue using these integrations, follow the instructions at the [ GitHub
repository ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dialogflow-integrations) .

##  December 19, 2019

**CHANGED:**

If you use the [ Telegram
](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/telegram?hl=ko)
integration, and the bot was created before August 19th, 2019, you must
restart the integration in the Dialogflow console by February 28th, 2020. To
restart it, perform the following steps for all your agents that use Telegram:

  1. Make sure you don't change or delete your current token on the Telegram side. 
  2. Open the agent in the Dialoglow Console. 
  3. In the integration settings, click the **STOP** button.

##  December 04, 2019

](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-mtls?hl=ko) to ensure
that webhook traffic is both secure and trusted.

**DEPRECATED:**

##  November 14, 2019

**CHANGED:**

We are extending the V1 API shutdown deadline to ~~March 31st, 2020~~ May
31st, 2020. Migrate to the V2 API as described [ here
](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v1-v2-migration-guide?hl=ko) .

If you use Dialogflow exclusively for Actions on Google, you don't need to
migrate your agent to the V2 API. However, note the following changes:

  * The Dialogflow simulator will show responses in the V2 format and the "Copy curl" button will generate requests in the V2 format. This should have no impact on the functionality of the Actions on Google simulator. 
  * You will no longer be able to call API methods for the V1 [ intents ](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/agent/intents?hl=ko) and [ entities ](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/agent/entities?hl=ko) resources. You will still be able to modify your agent using the Dialogflow Console. 

##  October 17, 2019

**CHANGED:**

When calling the API to provide an intent priority value, the behavior has
changed to the following:

  * If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the ` Normal ` priority in the console. 
  * If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests. 

Prior to this change, a value of 0 was stored as-is by the service. Any agents
created before this change may still have intent priority values of 0. For
runtime detect intent requests, a value of 0 is treated as -1, and the intent
is ignored.

##  October 01, 2019

](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-session?hl=ko) .

these entities in your existing agents, they will continue to function
