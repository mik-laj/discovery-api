##  April 21, 2020

**FEATURE:**

Cloud TPUs and Cloud TPU Pods now support PyTorch 1.5 via the PyTorch/XLA
integration. This integration makes it possible for PyTorch users to do
everything they can do on GPUs on Cloud TPUs, while minimizing changes to the
user experience. You can try out PyTorch on an 8-core Cloud TPU device for
free via Google Colab, and you can use PyTorch on Cloud TPUs at a much larger
scale on Google Cloud (all the way up to full Cloud TPU Pods).

See the ‚Å† [ PyTorch/XLA 1.5 Release Notes
](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/releases/tag/v1.5.0) for a complete list of
features included in this release.

**CHANGED:**

Cloud TPU now supports TensorFlow version 1.15.2 [ Release Notes
](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.15.2) . No changes
to the API or the [ official Cloud TPU supported models list
](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/support-matrix) has been
introduced with this release.

##  January 09, 2020

**FEATURE:**

Cloud TPU now supports TensorFlow 2.1 with Keras support. See the [ TensorFlow
2.1 Release Notes
](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.1.0) for a complete
list of features included in this release.

##  December 05, 2019

**FEATURE:**

Cloud TPU v2 and v3 Pods are now Generally Available for TensorFlow version
1.x. Supported models can be found [ here
](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/supported-models) .

Since TPU resources can scale from a single Cloud TPU to a Cloud TPU Pod, you
don't need to choose between a single Cloud TPU and a Cloud TPU Pod. You can
request portions of Cloud TPU Pods in slices or sets of cores, so that you
purchase only the processing power you need.

Cloud TPU v2 and v3 Pod advantages over a single v2 or v3 Cloud TPU device:

  * Increased training speeds for fast iteration in R&D *Increased human productivity by providing automatically scalable machine learning (ML) compute 
  * Ability to train much larger models 

Cloud TPU v3 Pod advantages over Cloud TPU v2 Pod:

  * Faster processing and larger memory: 
    * v2 Pod: 11.5 petaflops and 4 TB on-chip memory (HBM) 
    * v3 Pod: 100 petaflops and 32 TB HBM, with liquid cooling* Can train even larger models
